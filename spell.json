If you fail this caster level check, the magical rune is not triggered unless you fail the roll by 5 or more.<br/><br/> If you succeed at the caster level check, the rune is removed from the surface it was originally placed upon and duplicated on the cloth of a silk glove worn on your hand. The rune remains located on the glove\u2019s palm in an inert state for up to 1 minute per caster level.

Doing this also reduces the power of gifts and stains that vary based upon manifestation level. This application of <i>alleviate corruption</i> doesn\u2019t reduce the target\u2019s corruption stage.

A roll of natural 1 on the caster level check is an automatic failure. If you already have the same corruption, you must instead attempt an immediate saving throw against it.

This spell is similar to <i>animal messenger</i>, but can affect larger animals. In addition, the target animal is temporarily awakened to sentience (as the <i>awaken</i> spell) for the duration of this spell, and it can use its increased mental acuity to come up with creative solutions to overcome obstacles to delivering its message. The awakened target animal speaks any one language you know. In addition, you can imbue the animal with up to 5 ranks in any of the following skills: Bluff, Diplomacy, Knowledge (local), Knowledge (nobility), Linguistics, or Sense Motive. It treats any of these skills that are class skills for you as class skills. The number of ranks you imbue in any of these skills can\u2019t exceed the target animal\u2019s Hit Dice nor the number of ranks you possess in that skill.<br/><br/> The message you send with your <i>animal ambassador</i> can be a verbal message, which the awakened target animal can speak using its own voice or deliver using your voice. It can engage in conversation using its own intellect, knowledge, and linguistic abilities. The <i>animal ambassador </i>is loyal to you, but it is otherwise susceptible to mind-affecting effects like any other creature. You can also send your <i>animal ambassador</i> with an object or container that is within its physical ability to carry, making it deliver the contents to the target of your intended message. If the object it is given to carry is poisonous, trapped, or otherwise inherently dangerous (even if it would normally be dangerous only to the creature receiving it rather than the animal), or if you or your allies attack the target animal, the <i>animal ambassador </i>spell fails and the animal becomes hostile toward you. The <i>animal ambassador </i>intelligently but singlemindedly attempts to deliver the message to its intended target, and you can\u2019t task it with other tasks like fighting, scouting, searching for traps, and so on. It leaves on its delivery once it receives its message.<br/><br/> Once the <i>animal ambassador </i>has located its target and delivered its message (and object, if desired), its enhanced mental abilities fade within 2d6 minutes. The spell then ends, even if its duration hasn\u2019t elapsed.",

You can\u2019t transport an object to the Ethereal Plane. You can send the held object to any square within range, and you don\u2019t need line of sight to the target location. You can place the object in the open or inside a container, a pocket, or even someone\u2019s hand. If there isn\u2019t room in the space you select (either because the space chosen is too small or because there is already something else there), or if the person doesn\u2019t want or isn\u2019t expecting the object in his hands, it appears on the ground within the target\u2019s square instead. You can transport the object to an elevation above the floor as long as the destination is within the spell\u2019s total distance limit.<br/><br/><b>Receiving</b>: You can prepare an object ahead of time to apport it to yourself by casting the spell upon it and assigning a mental trigger to complete the spell. You don\u2019t need line of sight to the object to apport it to you, but the object must be within a distance equal to 25 feet + 5 feet per 2 levels. Completing the spell is a swift action that has the same restrictions as a thought spell component. You can apport an object in this way even if someone holding the object is unwilling to let you take it. Once you apport the object, the spell ends.<br/><br/>You can\u2019t send or receive an object into a space that is protected by an <i>antimagic field</i>, <i>globe of invulnerability</i>, or similar effect that keeps magical effects out; if you attempt to do so, the spell is lost.",

You can bring the astral forms of other willing creatures with you, provided that these subjects are linked in a circle with you at the time of the casting. These fellow travelers are dependent upon you and must accompany you at all times. If something happens to you during the journey, your companions are stranded wherever you left them.<br/><br/>You project your astral self onto the Astral Plane, leaving your physical body behind on the Material Plane in a state of suspended animation. The spell projects an astral copy of you and all you wear or carry onto the Astral Plane. Since the Astral Plane touches upon other planes, you can travel astrally to any of these other planes as you will. To enter one, you leave the Astral Plane, forming a new physical body (and equipment) on the plane of existence you have chosen to enter.<br/><br/>While you are on the Astral Plane, your astral body is connected at all times to your physical body by an incorporeal silver cord. If the cord is broken, you are killed, astrally and physically. Luckily, very few things can destroy a silver cord. When a second body is formed on a different plane, the silver cord remains invisibly attached to the new body. If the second body or the astral form is slain, the cord simply returns to your body where it rests on the Material Plane, thereby reviving it from its state of suspended animation. This is a traumatic affair, however, and you gain two permanent negative levels if your second body or astral form is slain. Although astral projections are able to function on the Astral Plane, their actions affect only creatures existing on the Astral Plane; a physical body must be materialized on other planes.<br/><br/>You and your companions may travel through the Astral Plane indefinitely. Your bodies simply wait behind in a state of suspended animation until you choose to return your spirits to them. The spell lasts until you desire to end it, or until it is terminated by some outside means, such as <i>dispel magic</i> cast upon either the physical body or the astral form, the breaking of the silver cord, or the destruction of your body back on the Material Plane (which kills you).<br/><br/>When this spell ends, your astral body and all of its gear, vanishes.<h1 class=\"title\"><img src=\"images\\PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px;\" title=\"",

If the transgression was intentional, the casting cleric must expend 2,500 gp in rare incense and offerings for her god's intercession.<br/><br/><i>Redemption or Temptation</i>: You may cast this spell upon a creature of an opposing alignment in order to offer it a chance to change its alignment to match yours. The prospective subject must be present for the entire casting process. Upon completion of the spell, the subject freely chooses whether it retains its original alignment or acquiesces to your offer and changes to your alignment.

When a creature enters the area, the haunt manifests, automatically grabbing the creature and dragging it under the water on initiative count 10. Each round, the haunt deals 1d6 points of nonlethal damage as it drags its victim down 10 feet; a successful DC 15 Swim check reduces the descent to 5 feet and negates the nonlethal damage. Each round in the haunt\u2019s clutches reduces the duration the victim can hold her breath by 2 rounds (<i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 445</i>). A victim can make a single move or standard action each round while in the haunt\u2019s grasp if she succeeds at a Will save; on a failed save, she can only struggle helplessly against the haunt. A victim cannot use her actions to swim toward the surface while the haunt is active. If the haunt reaches the bottom of its body of water, it pounds its victim against the bottom, dealing 2d6 points of nonlethal damage per round to the victim and reducing the duration the victim can hold her breath by an additional round. This continues until either the haunt is neutralized (in which case the victim must still swim to the surface) or the victim drowns. <br/><br/> The haunt can grab and attempt to drown multiple creatures in its area on its initiative count. The magic holding the haunt together is unstable and deteriorates while the haunt is active. Each round at the end of its turn, the haunt automatically loses 1d6 hit points per creature it is currently affecting. Furthermore, the spell\u2019s haunt-like manifestation is active throughout the spell\u2019s duration, rendering it vulnerable to effects that damage haunts.

    "des": "The spell creates an identical copy of you, along with everything you wear and carry, anywhere you choose within range; you exist in two places at once until the spell ends. You and the duplicate use the same statistics and share the same resources. If the duplicate takes damage, for example, you deduct the damage from your hit point total. Similarly, if your duplicate expends a charge or daily use from a magic item you both wield, the charge or daily use is expended from the item you carry. If you or the duplicate drops or gives away something you\u2019re carrying, the item disappears from the other body as well. This spell doesn\u2019t duplicate artifacts; any you possess remain on you.<br/><br/>You perceive sensory information from your body and that of your duplicate simultaneously. The spell enables you to process the sensations so you don\u2019t find them disorienting.<br/><br/>When you take any action, you choose which of your bodies performs the action, but both bodies share the same pool of actions. For instance, if you take a standard action to cast a spell, you can use either body as the point of origin, but the other body can\u2019t also take a standard action that round. Likewise, if your duplicate takes a full-round action, you couldn\u2019t take a standard or move action. Both bodies can take any number of free actions as usual; for example, both bodies could say different things or each drop a different item. If either body doesn\u2019t move during the round, that body can either take a 5-foot step or move your speed once as a free action.<br/><br/>The two bodies are affected by attacks, spells, and effects as though they were one person, taking the worse effect when applicable (for example, if the bodies would be subject to differing effects due to being at different ranges). If both bodies are in the area of the same <i>fireball</i>, you would attempt the saving throw only once and take the damage only once. If one body is targeted by <i>hold person</i>, both would become paralyzed on a failed save. Both bodies count as a single creature for effects that target a specific number of creatures, and they can\u2019t be chosen more than once for such effects. You do count your other body as another creature for most combat effects, such as flanking or determining cover. However, you don\u2019t count as two unique creatures for the purposes of teamwork feats or effects you use that can target only creatures other than yourself.<br/><br/>Any magical effect with a duration affecting you has its duration halved while you\u2019re bilocating. For example, the <i>hold person</i> spell mentioned above would lose 2 rounds\u2019 worth of duration per round until your duplicate disappeared. If you were under an <i>eagle\u2019s splendor</i> effect that had 1 minute remaining when you cast <i>bilocation</i>, the effect would end after 5 rounds instead of 10. An effect shortened in this way lasts a minimum of 1 round total, and if an effect that lasts an odd number of rounds has 1 round remaining, it has its full effect on both of your bodies for that round.<br/><br/>When the spell ends, you decide whether you or your duplicate disappears. If you disappear, you become your duplicate. If you are carrying artifacts when you do this, they transfer with your consciousness.<h1 class=\"title\"><img src=\"images\\PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px;\" title=\"",

    "des": "A <i>binding</i> spell creates a magical restraint to hold a creature. The target gets an initial saving throw only if its Hit Dice equal at least half your caster level.<br/><br/>You may have as many as six assistants help you with the spell. For each assistant who casts <i>suggestion</i>, your caster level for this casting of binding increases by 1. For each assistant who casts <i>dominate animal</i>, <i>dominate person</i>, or <i>dominate monster</i>, your caster level for this casting of <i>binding</i> increases by a number equal to a third of that assistant's level, provided that the spell's target is appropriate for a binding spell. Since the assistants' spells are cast simply to improve your caster level for the purpose of the <i>binding</i> spell, saving throws and spell resistance against the assistants' spells are irrelevant. Your caster level determines whether the target gets an initial Will saving throw and how long the binding lasts. All <i>binding</i> spells are dismissible.<br/><br/>Regardless of the version of <i>binding</i> you cast, you can specify triggering conditions that end the spell and release the creature whenever they occur. These triggers can be as simple or elaborate as you desire, but the condition must be reasonable and have a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, or hit points don't qualify. Once the spell is cast, its triggering conditions cannot be changed. Setting a release condition increases the save DC (assuming a saving throw is allowed) by 2.<br/><br/>If you cast any of the first three versions of <i>binding</i> (those with limited durations), you may cast additional <i>binding</i> spells to prolong the effect, overlapping the durations. If you do so, the target gets a saving throw at the end of the first spell's duration, even if your caster level was high enough to disallow an initial saving throw. If the creature's save succeeds, all <i>binding</i> spells it has received are broken.<br/><br/>The <i>binding</i> spell has six versions. Choose one of the following versions when you cast the spell.<br/><br/><i>Chaining</i>: The subject is confined by restraints that generate an <i>antipathy</i> spell affecting all creatures who approach the subject, except you. The duration is 1 year per caster level. The subject of this form of <i>binding</i> is confined to the spot it occupied when it received the spell. Casting this version requires a chain that is long enough to wrap around the creature three times.<br/><br/><i>Slumber</i>: This version causes the subject to become comatose for as long as 1 year per caster level. The subject does not need to eat or drink while slumbering, nor does it age. This form of <i>binding</i> is slightly easier to resist. Reduce the spell's save DC by 1. Casting this version requires a jar of sand or rose petals. This is a sleep effect.<br/><br/><i>Bound Slumber</i>: This combination of chaining and slumber lasts for as long as 1 month per caster level. Reduce the save DC by 2. Casting this version requires both a long chain and a jar of sand or rose petals. This is a sleep effect.<br/><br/><i>Hedged Prison</i>: The subject is transported to or otherwise brought within a confined area from which it cannot wander by any means. This effect is permanent. Reduce the save DC by 3. Casting this version requires a tiny golden cage worth 100 gp that is consumed when the spell is cast.<br/><br/><i>Metamorphosis</i>: The subject assumes gaseous form, except for its head or face. It is held harmless in a jar or other container, which may be transparent if you so choose. The creature remains aware of its surroundings and can speak, but it cannot leave the container, attack, or use any of its powers or abilities. The <i>binding</i> is permanent. The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while metamorphosed, nor does it age. Reduce the save DC by 4.<br/><br/><i>Minimus Containment</i>: The subject is shrunk to a height of 1 inch or less and held within some gem, jar, or similar object. The <i>binding</i> is permanent. The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while contained, nor does it age. Reduce the save DC by 4.<br/><br/>You can't dispel a <i>binding</i> spell with <i>dispel magic</i> or a similar effect, though an <i>antimagic field</i> or <i>mage's disjunction</i> affects it normally. A bound extraplanar creature cannot be sent back to its home plane by <i>dismissal</i>, <i>banishment</i>, or a similar effect.",

This wall provides total cover to all Large or smaller creatures and objects. The barrier can only spring up in an area of natural, unworked ground. The energy that forms the wall\u2019s matrix is unstable, and you must concentrate to maintain the wall\u2019s shape. A <i>blast barrier</i> has an AC of 9, hardness 0, and 5 hit points per caster level. When a <i>blast barrier </i>reaches 0 hit points, or when you cease concentrating on maintaining it, the energies that maintain the barrier\u2019s shape fail with explosive results, sending sharp chunks of the materials comprising the wall and magical energy out along both sides. Any creature that is adjacent to a <i>blast barrier</i> when it explodes takes 2d6 points of slashing damage and 1d6 points of sonic damage per 3 caster levels (maximum 6d6). A successful Reflex save halves the total damage done. Spell resistance applies as well.<br/><br/>This instability can make using a <i>blast barrier </i>risky, but many of the spellcasters that pioneered the spell became experts at its tactical applications, often using the barriers to cover an escape while lobbing spells and parting shots, hoping to trigger the barrier\u2019s destruction just as their would-be pursuers approached.",

Your own spells have a 20% chance to activate just as you go ethereal, in which case they typically do not affect the Material Plane (but they might affect targets on the Ethereal Plane).<br/><br/>While blinking, you take only half damage from area attacks (but full damage from those that extend onto the Ethereal Plane).

You do receive a +2 bonus on attack rolls made against enemies that cannot see invisible creatures.<br/><br/>You take only half damage from falling, since you fall only while you are material.<br/><br/>While blinking, you can step through (but not see through) solid objects. For each 5 feet of solid material you walk through, there is a 50% chance that you become material. If this occurs, you are shunted off to the nearest open space and take 1d6 points of damage per 5 feet so traveled.<br/><br/>Since you spend about half your time on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and even attack ethereal creatures.

Bonuses granted by these boons  are sacred bonuses if you channel positive energy or profane  bonuses if you channel negative energy.

If the original individual has been slain, its soul immediately transfers to the clone, creating a replacement (provided that the soul is free and willing to return). The original's physical remains, should they still exist, become inert and cannot thereafter be restored to life. If the original creature has reached the end of its natural life span (that is, it has died of natural causes), any cloning attempt fails.<br/><br/>To create the duplicate, you must have a piece of flesh (not hair, nails, scales, or the like) with a volume of at least 1 cubic inch that was taken from the original creature's living body. The piece of flesh need not be fresh, but it must be kept from rotting. Once the spell is cast, the duplicate must be grown in a laboratory for 2d4 months.<br/><br/>When the clone is completed, the original's soul enters it immediately, if that creature is already dead. The clone is physically identical to the original and possesses the same personality and memories as the original. In other respects, treat the clone as if it were the original character raised from the dead, including its gaining of two permanent negative levels, just as if it had been hit by an energy-draining creature. If the subject is 1st level, it takes 2 points of Constitution drain instead (if this would reduce its Con to 0 or less, it can't be cloned). If the original creature gained permanent negative levels since the flesh sample was taken, the clone gains these negative levels as well.<br/><br/>The spell duplicates only the original's body and mind, not its equipment. A duplicate can be grown while the original still lives, or when the original soul is unavailable, but the resulting body is merely a soulless bit of inert flesh which rots if not preserved.",

    "des": "You send out a magical message to any eldritch entities of a particular kind within a 100-mile radius, which can be delivered to up to 20 such creatures, starting with the nearest creatures until the limit has been met. This spell can\u2019t contact creatures with more than 6 Hit Dice. You can\u2019t send a specific message, but this spell (and all similar <i>contact entity</i> spells) can be characterized as an open invitation to make contact and establish communication. If there is an appropriate entity within range, the spell succeeds automatically. You don\u2019t know whether the message was received, nor any specific details about what creatures received it or how many. Creatures that receive the message know the location and distance from where the spell was cast. Because this spell doesn\u2019t call or summon the target, the target must have its own way to reach the place where the spell was cast.<br/><br/> How creatures respond to a contact spell is circumstantial and it is possible the creatures will simply ignore the spell. Creatures that come and investigate do so in their own time. They usually arrive cautiously, aware of the potential for ambush. Targets of the spell might inform their organization or community if they have one. There are no restrictions on how the creatures react to being contacted, and they might respond with hostility, parley, entertain an alliance, or subjugate the caster and their related community. Using this spell counts as mentally contacting the creature for the purpose of any of its special abilities (such as the star-spawn\u2019s overwhelming mind). For the purpose of spells like <i>scrying</i>, the creature has firsthand knowledge of you and a connection similar to if it possessed a likeness of you.<br/><br/> Each type of creature requires a different material component that must be included when casting the spell, as shown on Table 4\u20131: Contact Entity on page 112. Some of these components are expensive or might require quests to acquire.

If you lose Intelligence and Charisma, the effect strikes as soon as the first question is asked, and no answer is received.

You must be on the Astral or Ethereal Plane or on a plane that has access to one of those planes (such as the Material Plane) to cast this spell.<br/><br/>When you cast the spell, you decide whether the demiplane is within the Astral or the Ethereal Plane. It is filled with air or water (decided by you). The plane is generally flat and featureless, such as an earth, stone, water, or wood floor. The \u201cwalls\u201d and \u201cceiling\u201d of the plane may appear like solid earth, stone, wood, or water, or they may end in mist, a featureless void, or a similar unreal-looking border. The plane\u2019s environmental conditions are those of a temperate spring day on the Material Plane. You determine the plane\u2019s light level (bright, normal, dim, or darkness), which affects the entire plane.<br/><br/>There are no native creatures or plants on this plane, though you may bring some there (if the plane\u2019s light is bright or normal, it counts as sunlight for growing plants). The environment of the plane counts as normal terrain for the purpose of effects that target earth, stone, wood, and so on. For example, you could use <i>move earth </i>to create a hill or <i>wall of stone </i>to create a barricade.<br/><br/>When you finish casting this spell, you may bring yourself and up to seven other creatures to the plane automatically by joining hands in a circle. The demiplane is another plane of existence, and therefore is outside the range of any spell or ability that cannot affect or reach other planes. Creatures can only enter the plane by the use of planar travel magic such as <i>astral projection</i>, <i>etherealness</i>, or <i>plane shift</i>. You are considered \u201cvery familiar\u201d with your entire demiplane.<br/><br/>As a standard action, you may eject a creature from your demiplane. The creature may resist with a Will saving throw. An ejected creature goes to the closest plane to your demiplane (usually the Astral Plane or the Ethereal Plane, but if you cast this spell on the Material Plane, the creature is sent to the Material Plane). When the spell ends, the plane dissolves, and all creatures in the plane are ejected in this manner with no saving throw. The plane cannot be dispelled, but a creature on the plane can destroy it by using <i>limited wish</i>, <i>mage\u2019s disjunction</i>, <i>miracle</i>, or <i>wish </i>and making a successful dispel check.<br/><br/>If you are within the demiplane, you can add to its area by casting the spell again. Alternatively, you may cast this spell again to reset the duration of an existing area to that of your latest casting. If the duration on one area of the demiplane ends and other parts remain, creatures in the expiring area are shunted to remaining areas.

    "des": "You create a small, finite demiplane. You must be on the Astral or Ethereal Plane or on a plane that has access to one of those planes (such as the Material Plane) to cast this spell.<br/><br/>When you cast the spell, you decide whether the demiplane is within the Astral or the Ethereal Plane. It is filled with air or water (decided by you). The plane is generally flat and featureless, such as an earth, stone, water, or wood floor. The \u201cwalls\u201d and \u201cceiling\u201d of the plane may appear like solid earth, stone, wood, or water, or they may end in mist, a featureless void, or a similar unreal-looking border. The plane\u2019s environmental conditions are those of a temperate spring day on the Material Plane. You determine the plane\u2019s light level (bright, normal, dim, or darkness), which affects the entire plane.<br/><br/>There are no native creatures or plants on this plane, though you may bring some there (if the plane\u2019s light is bright or normal, it counts as sunlight for growing plants). The environment of the plane counts as normal terrain for the purpose of effects that target earth, stone, wood, and so on. For example, you could use <i>move earth </i>to create a hill or <i>wall of stone </i>to create a barricade.<br/><br/>When you finish casting this spell, you may bring yourself and up to seven other creatures to the plane automatically by joining hands in a circle. The demiplane is another plane of existence, and therefore is outside the range of any spell or ability that cannot affect or reach other planes. Creatures can only enter the plane by the use of planar travel magic such as <i>astral projection</i>, <i>etherealness</i>, or <i>plane shift</i>. You are considered \u201cvery familiar\u201d with your entire demiplane.<br/><br/>As a standard action, you may eject a creature from your demiplane. The creature may resist with a Will saving throw. An ejected creature goes to the closest plane to your demiplane (usually the Astral Plane or the Ethereal Plane, but if you cast this spell on the Material Plane, the creature is sent to the Material Plane). When the spell ends, the plane dissolves, and all creatures in the plane are ejected in this manner with no saving throw. The plane cannot be dispelled, but a creature on the plane can destroy it by using <i>limited wish</i>, <i>mage\u2019s disjunction</i>, <i>miracle</i>, or <i>wish </i>and making a successful dispel check.<br/><br/>If you are within the demiplane, you can add to its area by casting the spell again. Alternatively, you may cast this spell again to reset the duration of an existing area to that of your latest casting. If the duration on one area of the demiplane ends and other parts remain, creatures in the expiring area are shunted to remaining areas. If a collapsing portion of the demiplane would leave one section cut off from other sections of the demiplane (for example, if there were three areas connected in a straight line and the center part expired), the stranded sections count as separate demiplanes under your control.

A creature that takes a dose of one of these drug typically must be either willing or helpless, though some drugs might be inhaled, applied to injuries, or secretly slipped into food if the caster acts swiftly (see each drug\u2019s description). The DC to resist a drug created by this spell is based on the conjurer\u2019s caster level, not the DC listed in the common versions of the drug.

    "des": "You create an immersive mindscape (see page 235) that the minds of both you and another creature enter together. You choose whether the mindscape is overt or veiled, and whether it\u2019s harmless or harmful. You can choose any shape and size trait, as well as any gravity trait (though you can\u2019t make it so the gravity is so strong it harms creatures within). The mindscape has normal time, no alignment traits, and normal magic.<br/><br/>You designate where both you and your subject appear. You don\u2019t need line of sight to draw the subject creature into the mindscape, but you must be aware of its presence within range. If you target an area with more than one sentient creature and you have never seen any of the creatures before (for example, if you know a group of soldiers is inside a barracks but you can\u2019t see them through the door), the subject of this spell is selected at random. If you have seen firsthand the creature you wish to target (continuing the example, if you spied the sergeant entering the room moments before), you can select it unerringly from among all the creatures. You must appear somewhere in your mindscape, though it\u2019s relatively easy to shield yourself from the view of any other creatures inside if they don\u2019t realize they\u2019re in a mindscape. You must also create a method of exit from the mindscape when you cast this spell, and that method must be possible to achieve based on the traits of the mindscape, even if it is obscure or difficult. The GM decides whether a method of escape is reasonable. Anything that would be a reasonable method of waking from a dream during deep sleep could allow one to leave a mindscape.<br/><br/>More creatures than the initial two can enter an existing mindscape, typically through the use of the <i>mindscape door</i> spell. You can create illusory creatures within the mindscape, but you\u2019re able to direct or concentrate on only one at a time. Only this creature is believable; any others largely remain silent or speak generic, repetitive phrases.<br/><br/>As is normal with mindscapes, you and any other creatures within the mindscape are unable to take actions within the real world, and your bodies lose their Dexterity bonuses to AC.<br/><br/>If you choose to create a veiled mindscape, the first time another creature interacts with the environment, it can attempt a Will save to disbelieve the effect. Disbelieving a mindscape reveals to that creature that it\u2019s within a mindscape and gives it the knowledge needed to leave the mindscape, but doesn\u2019t free it from the mindscape. For example, if you create a mindscape that takes the form of a parlor inside a stately mansion, and your target creature succeeds at its Will save, it gains the understanding that walking out the front door of the mansion allows it to return to its physical body, but it must actually move through the mental landscape of the mansion to reach the front door and exit in order to flee the mindscape. If the mindscape is overt, the creature automatically knows how to exit if it so chooses.<br/><br/>This spell ends at any time that you choose to depart the mindscape, freeing the target as well. Any creature that drops below 0 hit points while inside the mindscape returns to its body. If this happens to you, the spell also ends, freeing anyone still inside.<br/><br/><i>Create mindscape</i> can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell by a caster of 12th level or higher at a cost of 10,000 gp.

    "des": "You can use <i>dispel magic</i> to end one ongoing spell that has been cast on a creature or object, to temporarily suppress the magical abilities of a magic item, or to counter another spellcaster's spell. A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be defeated by <i>dispel magic</i>. <i>Dispel magic</i> can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells. The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the magical effect is already over before the <i>dispel magic</i> can take effect.<br/><br/>You choose to use <i>dispel magic</i> in one of two ways: a targeted dispel or a counterspell.<br/><br/><i>Targeted Dispel</i>: One object, creature, or spell is the target of the dispel magic spell. You make one dispel check (1d20 + your caster level) and compare that to the spell with highest caster level (DC = 11 + the spell's caster level). If successful, that spell ends. If not, compare the same result to the spell with the next highest caster level. Repeat this process until you have dispelled one spell affecting the target, or you have failed to dispel every spell.<br/><br/>For example, a 7th-level caster casts <i>dispel magic</i>, targeting a creature affected by <i>stoneskin</i> (caster level 12th) and <i>fly</i> (caster level 6th). The caster level check results in a 19. This check is not high enough to end the <i>stoneskin</i> (which would have required a 23 or higher), but it is high enough to end the <i>fly</i> (which only required a 17). Had the dispel check resulted in a 23 or higher, the <i>stoneskin</i> would have been dispelled, leaving the <i>fly</i> intact. Had the dispel check been a 16 or less, no spells would have been affected.<br/><br/>You can also use a targeted dispel to specifically end one spell affecting the target or one spell affecting an area (such as a <i>wall of fire</i>). You must name the specific spell effect to be targeted in this way. If your caster level check is equal to or higher than the DC of that spell, it ends. No other spells or effects on the target are dispelled if your check is not high enough to end the targeted effect.<br/><br/>If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by <i>summon monster</i>), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.<br/><br/>If the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item's caster level (DC = 11 + the item's caster level). If you succeed, all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers its magical properties. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional opening (such as a bag of holding) is temporarily closed. A magic item's physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.<br/><br/>You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself.<br/><br/><i>Counterspell</i>: When <i>dispel magic</i> is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell. Unlike a true counterspell, however, <i>dispel magic</i> may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell.<h2 class=\"title\">Mythic Dispel Magic</h2><b>Source</b> <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Mythic Adventures pg. 92</i></a><br/>When used as a targeted dispel, this spell can end two spells affecting the target instead of just one. If the targeted dispel successfully dispels at least one spell, you heal 1d4 points of damage for every spell level of the dispelled spell. If you dispel two spells, this healing applies only to the highest-level spell dispelled. If you use this spell to counterspell, roll your dispel check twice and take the higher result. <h1 class=\"title\"><img src=\"images\\PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px;\" title=\"",

When trying to locate the dreamscape of a creature known to you through a false identity, roll 1d20 + 80 on the table to obtain your results (instead of rolling d%), since there is no way for you to pinpoint the correct dreamscape.<br/><br/><b>On Target</b>: You travel to the correct creature\u2019s current dreamscape.<br/><br/><b>Off Target</b>: You travel to an area near the target dreamscape on the Ethereal Plane.<br/><br/><b>Other Dreamscape</b>: You travel to a similar creature\u2019s dreamscape on the Dimension of Dreams.<br/><br/><b>Mishap</b>: You and anyone else traveling with you experience a mishap during travel; each character takes 1d10 points of damage and must reroll on the table to see where it ends up.

If you and the other creatures are still in a dream when the dreamer wakes up, the dreamer can decide to bring you out onto its plane within 1d10 miles of itself. If it chooses not to, you and the other travelers are pushed into another dreamscape or onto the Ethereal Plane. The spell ends when the creature wakes up, so you no longer have the option to dismiss the spell and return home. However, you do get enough warning that a spell is about to end that you can dismiss it before the dreamer awakens and decides whether to allow you to arrive at its location.<br/><br/>You can use <i>dream travel</i> to travel to the dream of a creature on another plane, but this requires trekking through the dreams of outsiders. It takes 1d4+1 hours of uninterrupted travel to reach the destination dream, and each traveler must succeed at a Will save each hour spent traveling in this fashion. The DC of this save is 10 for the first hour, and increases by 5 for each hour thereafter. If a creature fails this saving throw, it becomes shaken for the remainder of the <i>dream travel</i> and for a number of hours thereafter equal to the amount of time spent using <i>dream travel</i> to reach the destination plane. After the first time a creature fails the saving throw, one of the following effects occurs (determined randomly by the GM). These effects are considered emotion effects, in addition to any other descriptors that apply.<br/><br/> <table class=\"inner\"><tr><td><b>d6</b></td><td><b>Result</b></td></tr> <tr><td>1</td><td>Creature contracts cackle fever or mindfire (equal chance of either; see page 557 of the <i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i>).</td></tr> <tr><td>2</td><td>Creature is cursed, as <i>bestow curse</i>; if the creature is a spellcaster, it instead acquires a random minor spellblight (<i>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic</i> 94).</td></tr> <tr><td>3</td><td>Creature is attacked by a <i>phantasmal killer</i>, and is treated as having failed the initial saving throw to disbelieve it. The Fortitude save DC is equal to the Will save DC that the creature failed.</td></tr> <tr><td>4</td><td>Creature is possessed as <i>possession</i> (see page 181) by an outsider (50% chance to be a creature from the destination plane; otherwise, it is a random hostile outsider).</td></tr> <tr><td>5</td><td>Creature is affected as <i>feeblemind</i>.</td></tr> <tr><td>6</td><td>Creature is affected as <i>insanity</i>.</td></tr></table><br/> Traveling to a different planar destination decreases the accuracy of your dream transit. If you exit a creature\u2019s dream onto a plane different from the plane you started on, you end up in a random location on the destination plane.<br/><br/>If the target of your <i>dream travel</i> isn\u2019t dreaming, you and the other travelers can wait on the Dimension of Dreams until that creature begins sleeping. For each hour that passes during this wait, each dream traveler must attempt a Will save as if it were traveling to reach another plane.",

All creatures that disembark from the vehicle onto a plane at the same time arrive in the same place. The dreamer can\u2019t prevent the dream voyagers from entering its dream, but can attempt a Will save to prevent a group of creatures from exiting to the plane where its body resides.<br/><br/>The psychic vehicle remains in the dream for the remainder of the spell\u2019s duration, even if it\u2019s unoccupied. A creature adjacent to the dreamer can reenter the dream vessel as a full-round action through an illusory portal only subjects of the spell can see. You can return the vessel to the point where you cast <i>dream voyage</i> to allow any number of passengers to return to that plane, and can return it to the dream again. Either of these trips takes the same amount of time as the initial travel, and can be done any number of times within the spell\u2019s duration. If the vessel moves out of a dreamscape, companions left behind can\u2019t return to the vessel by being near the dreamer. If a companion is killed, its body doesn\u2019t return to the <i>dream voyage</i> unless you carry it with you, just like any other object.<br/><br/>If the dreamer awakens while the dream vessel is still in its dream, it can allow the dream travelers to exit or not (as with <i>dream travel</i>).

Hardness does not reduce this damage, nor is it halved as damage dealt to objects normally is. Any creature caught inside a collapsing structure takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below).<br/><br/><i>River, Lake, or Marsh</i>: Fissures open under the water, draining away the water from that area and forming muddy ground.

This spell allows you to leave your body and subconsciously monitor the immediate area around any depiction of your image whether one, hundreds, or even thousands. Each such image has the full range of your normal senses (sight, hearing, smell, etc.) and you can make a Perception check to notice anything occurring nearby. The DC of this check is always 10 greater than what it would be if you were actually present at that location, so even if you would normally notice something automatically (such as talking, normally a DC of 0), you would need to make a DC 10 Perception check to notice it. <br/><br/>You may, at any time, choose to fill one specific image within range with your consciousness. While inside an image you lose the ability to monitor any other images within range but remain fully aware of your own body\u2019s surroundings. Your body is defenseless and helpless (always failing any saving throw) while your consciousness is filling an image, but you can return to it at any time as an immediate action.<br/><br/> When you fill an image with your consciousness it gains a limited form of animation. Statues and similar three-dimensional representations can move their heads, make gestures, and talk, but cannot attack or leave their square without assistance. Portraits or similar two-dimensional representations bearing your likeness can also talk and your image can move anywhere within the picture or even temporarily alter it (such as by picking a flower in the painting). You cannot use any spells or other abilities while within an image. <br/><br/>You may leave the image at any time, returning you to your body. Once your consciousness departs from an object bearing your likeness, it immediately reverts to the appearance it had before you entered it. If someone destroys or damages the image you return to your body unharmed.

Once a visitor has passed through the entry point, they find themselves in an idyllic twilight meadow surrounded by an impassable grove of fruit and nut trees. The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm.<br/><br/> You can configure the meadow into any shape you desire, to the limit of the spell\u2019s effect. The place is comfortable and temperate. The trees can provide enough food to sustain 4 people per caster level for a day. A staff of near-transparent animal or feylike servants (as many as two per caster level) wait upon all who enter. The servants function as <i>unseen servant </i>spells except that they are visible and can go anywhere in the meadow.<br/><br/> Since the place can be entered only through its special portal, outside conditions do not affect the meadow, nor do conditions inside it pass to the plane beyond.",

As noted in <i>animate dead</i>, you can\u2019t control more than 4 HD per caster level worth of undead in total, nor can a single casting create more than 2 HD per caster level.<br/><br/> This spell disguises the zombie\u2019s appearance and allows you to control it. The zombie\u2019s outward appearance, movement, and voice appear the same as if it were still alive. The zombie\u2019s normal staggered condition doesn\u2019t apply (though it can still be staggered by other means). Successfully detecting the <i>flesh puppet</i> as a zombie without magic requires an opposed Perception check against your Disguise check, and you add your caster level as a bonus on this Disguise check.<br/><br/> An ephemeral string connects you to the zombie. Through this string, you have a mental link to the zombie and can command it as a swift action. The zombie uses its own actions to complete your commands. The zombie can speak up to 25 words in 1 round, but you must mentally impart what you intend it to say as a swift action. It is incapable of articulating speech on its own. The zombie can be ordered to perform very simple tasks it knew in life but can\u2019t make attacks, cast spells, or perform complex or difficult tasks requiring constant concentration.<br/><br/> The string connecting you and the zombie is nearly invisible. A DC 30 Perception check is required to detect it. It has hardness 0 and 1 hp. The length of string you can create is 100 feet + 10 feet per caster level you have. The string snaps if you and the zombie move farther apart than this length, though the zombie won\u2019t move out of range unless forced to do so or unless you command it to do so. If the string to the zombie is severed, the spell immediately ends. The ephemeral string can pass through physical barriers, but not barriers of magical force, and it can be damaged as though it were a physical object.<br/><br/> When this spell ends, the zombie immediately reverts back to a normal corpse.

First, it creates an interdimensional connection between your plane of existence and a plane you specify, allowing travel between those two planes in either direction.<br/><br/>Second, you may then call a particular individual or kind of being through the <i>gate</i>.<br/><br/>The <i>gate</i> itself is a circular hoop or disk from 5 to 20 feet in diameter (caster's choice) oriented in the direction you desire when it comes into existence (typically vertical and facing you). It is a two-dimensional window looking into the plane you specified when casting the spell, and anyone or anything that moves through is shunted instantly to the other side.<br/><br/>A <i>gate</i> has a front and a back. Creatures moving through the <i>gate</i> from the front are transported to the other plane; creatures moving through it from the back are not.<br/><br/><i>Planar Travel</i>: As a mode of planar travel, a <i>gate</i> spell functions much like a <i>plane shift</i> spell, except that the <i>gate</i> opens precisely at the point you desire (a creation effect). Deities and other beings who rule a planar realm can prevent a gate from opening in their presence or personal demesnes if they so desire. Travelers need not join hands with you\u2014anyone who chooses to step through the portal is transported. A gate cannot be opened to another point on the same plane; the spell works only for interplanar travel.<br/><br/>You may hold the <i>gate</i> open only for a brief time (no more than 1 round per caster level), and you must concentrate on doing so, or else the interplanar connection is severed.<br/><br/><i>Calling Creatures</i>: The second effect of the <i>gate</i> spell is to call an extraplanar creature to your aid (a calling effect). By naming a particular being or kind of being as you cast the spell, you cause the <i>gate</i> to open in the immediate vicinity of the desired creature and pull the subject through, willing or unwilling. Deities and unique beings are under no compulsion to come through the <i>gate</i>, although they may choose to do so of their own accord. This use of the spell creates a <i>gate</i> that remains open just long enough to transport the called creatures. This use of the spell has a material cost of 10,000 gp in rare incense and offerings. This cost is in addition to any cost that must be paid to the called creatures.<br/><br/>If you choose to call a kind of creature instead of a known individual, you may call either a single creature or several creatures. In either case, their total HD cannot exceed twice your caster level. In the case of a single creature, you can control it if its HD does not exceed your caster level. A creature with more HD than your caster level can't be controlled. Deities and unique beings cannot be controlled in any event. An uncontrolled being acts as it pleases, making the calling of such creatures rather dangerous. An uncontrolled being may return to its home plane at any time.<br/><br/>If you choose to exact a longer or more involved form of service from a called creature, you must offer some fair trade in return for that service. The service exacted must be reasonable with respect to the promised favor or reward; see the <i>lesser planar ally</i> spell for appropriate rewards. Some creatures may want their payment in \u201clivestock\u201d rather than in coin, which could involve complications. Immediately upon completion of the service, the being is transported to your vicinity, and you must then and there turn over the promised reward. After this is done, the creature is instantly freed to return to its own plane.<br/><br/>Failure to fulfill the promise to the letter results in your being subjected to service by the creature or by its liege and master, at the very least. At worst, the creature or its kin may attack you.<br/><br/><i>Note</i>: When you use a calling spell such as gate to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it becomes a spell of that type.<h1 class=\"title\"><img src=\"images\\PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px;\" title=\"",

The power and abilities of this vestige correspond directly to the value of the offering, allowing for three distinct effects.<br/><br/><i>Corrupted Coin</i>: Making a sacrifice worth 1,500 gp corrupts the focus into a \u201clucky\u201d or \u201cunlucky\u201d coin as per the caster\u2019s will for 1 month. Any creature that bears the coin gains a bonus or penalty (decided by the caster at the time of casting) on all Appraise, Bluff, Craft, and Profession checks. This bonus or penalty is equal to 1 per 3 caster levels (maximum +5 at 15th level). In addition, the coin can produce an effect similar to the spell <i>augury</i> once per day\u2014its flip producing a weal (heads), woe (tails), or nothing result (landing on the edge). Potentially unknown to the bearer (if different from the caster), the caster can telepathically hear any question asked of the coin and, as a free action, influence the result as he chooses.<br/><br/><i>Mammon\u2019s Mantle</i>: Making a sacrifice worth 3,000 gp transforms the coin into a kind of infernal aegis for any who swallow the coin. Upon ingesting the coin, the target gains a bonus to Charisma equal to +1 per 3 caster levels (maximum +5 at 15th level). The bearer\u2019s blood also takes on a hue like liquid gold and runs slowly, granting him immunity to poison, disease, and aging effects, and causing him to automatically stabilize if reduced to fewer than 0 hit points. Additionally, the bearer can eat gold to heal himself, regaining 1 hit point for every 20 gold pieces he consumes (materials other than gold provide no benefit). The coin\u2019s effects last for 1 day per caster level.<br/><br/><i>Gold Guardian</i>: Making a sacrifice worth 6,000 gp allows the focus coin to animate nearby coins. When cast into a pile of 100,000 coins, an animate hoard (see <i>Pathfinder #30: The Twice-Damned Prince</i> pg. 68) forms under the control of the caster. The guardian serves for 1 month. After this month, coins begin disappearing from the guardian at a rate of 100 gp per day, reducing the creature\u2019s hit points by 1 per day. When the guardian\u2019s hit points reach 0, the guardian collapses and the focus coin is destroyed. Coins lost from the guardian can be replaced, restoring any lost hit points.<br/><br/>In addition to the effects of any of these offerings, should the focus coin be swallowed, any being sired or conceived by the creature while the magic is in effect is born as a <a href=\"RacesDisplay.aspx?ItemName=tiefling\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\">tiefling</a> (bearing an indirect relation to Mammon himself ).",

If the coin is held or carried by a creature, its owner receives any applicable saving throw against the effect. The caster of <i>gilded whispers</i> treats the coin as a familiar subject. The residual psychic impressions left upon the coin by other handlers help mask this dweomer from detection, protecting <i>gilded whispers</i> against location by <i>detect magic</i>, <i>arcane sight</i>, and similar effects unless the latter spell\u2019s caster succeeds on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against a DC of 11 + the caster level of the spellcaster who cast <i>gilded whispers</i>.

See page 18 for rules on the effects of high, low, and no gravity.<br/><br/> Creatures that fall within the area of a <i>gravity sphere</i> spell take more damage from the fall if the gravity within is higher and less damage if the gravity within is lower. However, if the creature falls through a <i>gravity sphere</i> and continues to fall in a non-affected area, the rest of the fall damage is calculated normally. For instance, if a creature falls through 20 feet of a lowgravity sphere and an additional 30 feet outside the sphere, it would take 1d6 points of damage for the 20 feet of low gravity plus 3d6 points of damage as normal for the 30 feet outside the sphere (for a total of 4d6 points of damage).<br/><br/> This spell doesn\u2019t counteract or negate the effects of other spells that affect gravity; both effects occur simultaneously.

The warded area can be as much as 20 feet high, and shaped as you desire. You can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among them; you must be somewhere within the area to be warded to cast the spell. The spell creates the following magical effects within the warded area.<br/><br/><i>Fog</i>: Fog fills all corridors, obscuring all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target). Saving Throw: none. Spell Resistance: no.<br/><br/><i>Arcane Locks</i>: All doors in the warded area are <i>arcane locked</i>. Saving Throw: none. Spell Resistance: no.<br/><br/><i>Webs</i>: Webs fill all stairs from top to bottom. These strands are identical with those created by the <i>web</i> spell, except that they regrow in 10 minutes if they are burned or torn away while the <i>guards and wards</i> spell lasts. Saving Throw: Reflex negates; see text for <i>web</i>. Spell Resistance: no.<br/><br/><i>Confusion</i>: Where there are choices in direction\u2014such as a corridor intersection or side passage\u2014a minor <i>confusion</i>-type effect functions so as to make it 50% probable that intruders believe they are going in the opposite direction from the one they actually chose. This is a mind-affecting effect. Saving Throw: none.

Saving Throw: Will disbelief (if interacted with). Spell Resistance: no.<br/><br/>In addition, you can place your choice of one of the following five magical effects.<br/><br/>1. <i>Dancing lights</i> in four corridors.

If you cast <i>harrowing</i> on another creature, you must remain adjacent to the target for the duration of the casting time. A harrowing must describe one set of events or course of action (for example, \u201chunting down the pirate king,\u201d or \u201ctraveling to Viperwall to search for a magic sword\u201d) that the target of the spell intends to undertake at some point during the spell\u2019s duration.<br/><br/>If you have access to a Harrow deck, draw nine cards when this spell is cast. If you do not have a Harrow deck, you can simulate the draws by rolling a d6 and a d10 for each of the nine cards, as detailed on page 293 of this book. Record the ability score and alignment associated with each card. Each of these cards grants a luck bonus or a penalty on a specific type of d20 check; the magnitude of the penalty or bonus depends upon how closely that particular card\u2019s alignment matches the target creature\u2019s alignment. If the card and target\u2019s alignments are identical, that card provides a +2 luck bonus on the associated suit\u2019s check. If the card and target\u2019s alignments are of the opposite alignment (see below), the card inflicts a \u20131 penalty on that associated check. If the card has any other alignment, it provides a +1 luck bonus on the associated suit\u2019s check.<br/><br/>While penalties persist on all associated checks for as long as the harrowing persists, the bonuses are one-use bonuses that the harrowed character can \u201cspend\u201d at any time to modify that card\u2019s associated check.

When targeting a divine spellcaster, you can designate an alignment.

A creature that succeeds at its saving throw to avoid being shaken by its ally\u2019s blasphemous litany is immune to the litany\u2019s effects and need not attempt additional saves on subsequent rounds.",

A creature that occupies a square from which a spear extends (or that is within 10 feet of the ground below) takes 2d6 points of piercing damage and 2d6 points of cold damage per square\u2014creatures that take up more than 1 square can be hit by multiple spears if your caster level is high enough. The explosive growth can also trip foes. When the spears erupt from the ground, they attempt a combat maneuver check to trip any targets that take damage from the spears, with a total bonus equal to your caster level plus your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier, whichever is highest. Each additional ice spear beyond the first that strikes a single foe grants a +10 bonus on this combat maneuver check. If the check is successful, the ice spears knock the foe prone. A successful Reflex save halves the damage and prevents the trip attempt.<br/><br/> If you cast this spell upon an area covered with ice or snow, such as a glacier, frozen lake, or snow-covered field, the spears strike with additional force. Saves against the effect take a \u20132 penalty, and the spell effect gains a +4 bonus on the combat maneuver check to trip foes.<br/><br/> <i>Ice spears </i>created by this spell remain after they do their damage. They melt as normal depending on the surrounding environment. They no longer damage foes in their square, but can provide cover. An <i>ice spear </i>has hardness 5 and 30 hit points.",

You do not control the devil or have any influence over how it conducts itself in battle, but the devil cannot leave the testing ground. Unlike with summon monster and similar spells, you cannot dismiss the devil. Rather, the conjured devil remains until any one of the following criteria is met: it is reduced below 0 hit points or otherwise defeated, its challenger is slain, its challenger leaves the testing ground, or it takes damage from any source other than its challenger. Upon any of these occurrences, the devil vanishes.<br/><br/> Conjuring a devil is typically an evil act. If cast for any purpose besides the administering of a Hellknight test, this spell has the evil descriptor.",

    "des": "This spell infuses an effigy with a powerful curse that targets a specific type of creature associated in some way with the effigy itself. When you cast this spell, it remains in effect until it is discharged. Once you cast <i>infuse effigy</i>, you cannot prepare a new 4th-level spell to replace it or cast another spell with its spell slot until you dismiss the <i>infuse effigy</i> spell or until it is discharged against a foe. If the number of 4th-level spells that you can cast decreases, and that number drops below your current number of <i>infuse effigy </i>spells, the more recently cast <i>infuse effigy </i>spells in excess of the number of 4th-level spells you can now cast are dispelled.<br/><br/>The nature of the curse that becomes infused into the effigy you touch depends more on the nature of the effigy than anything else. You can cast this spell on a standard effigy (such as a head stuck onto a spike, or on a body hanging from a tree), but can generate more powerful effects by casting the spell on one of the more elaborate effigies detailed above\u2014in this case, it is the established traditions of the effigy as much as the effigy itself that empowers the curse. The larger effigies, such as the tree of souls and the wicker man, have minimum caster level requirements; you must be this level or higher in order to cast <i>infuse effigy</i> on such a target.<br/><br/>Once an effigy is infused, it radiates an aura of unease to a radius of 5 feet per caster level\u2014the first time a creature enters this area, it must make a Will save or become shaken for 1 minute per caster level. This effect can only occur once per creature and is a mind-affecting fear effect. As long as an effigy remains under the effects of this spell, the body parts associated with the effigy become preserved as if by <i>gentle repose</i>. Once an effigy has been the focus for an <i>infuse effigy</i> spell, it can never again be the target of this spell\u2014a new effigy must be constructed from new victims if you wish to recreate it. An infused effigy is treated as a magic item for the purposes of saving throws.<br/><br/>An infused effigy has an additional effect on creatures of the same type as the largest creature incorporated into the effigy. If the largest creature is a humanoid or outsider, the additional effect only affects creatures of the largest creature\u2019s subtype. Creatures of this type (and subtype) take a \u20132 penalty on the saving throw against the effigy\u2019s aura, and as soon as such creatures attack or damage the effigy (from any distance) or approach within 10 feet of it, they must make a Will saving throw or become cursed. If a creature becomes cursed by an infused effigy, the spell effect on the effigy ends (and the caster can now use that spell slot to prepare or cast spells again), but the curse itself is permanent until it is removed. If the creature that triggers the effigy was close friends with or related to anyone whose body was used to construct the effigy, that creature takes a \u20134 penalty on the Will save to avoid becoming cursed. The specific effects of each type of effigy\u2019s curse are listed below. At the GM\u2019s discretion, other specific effigies might exist, along with specific effects they exhibit when they are the subject of an <i>infuse effigy </i>spell.<br/><br/><b>Standard Effigy Curse (no minimum CL)</b>: \u20132 penalty to an ability score chosen by the caster.<br/><br/><b>Blood Eagle Curse (no minimum CL)</b>: \u20134 penalty to Constitution and \u20134 penalty on all saving throws against fear effects.<br/><br/><b>Nithing Pole Curse (no minimum CL)</b>: Any effect that can be generated by a <i>bestow curse </i>spell.<br/><br/><b>Tree of Souls Curse (minimum CL 11th)</b>: The victim heals damage from rest at half normal rate, and any magical healing applied to the victim must succeed at a DC 20 Caster Level check or be negated. The cursed victim takes a \u20134 penalty on all Constitution-based checks, including stabilization checks and Fortitude saving throws.<br/><br/><b>Wicker Man Curse (minimum CL 15th)</b>: \u20136 penalty to two ability scores chosen by the caster. In addition, each time the victim takes damage from any source, it takes an additional 1d6 points of fire damage as its flesh burns and blisters around the wound. It takes a \u20136 penalty on all saving throws against fire effects. Unless it has the Fire subtype, the victim loses any racial resistance or immunity to fire.",

Any part of an item that the subject carries but that extends more than 10 feet from it becomes visible.<br/><br/>Of course, the subject is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the recipient detectable (such as swimming in water or stepping in a puddle). If a check is required, a stationary invisible creature has a +40 bonus on its Stealth checks. This bonus is reduced to +20 if the creature is moving. The spell ends if the subject attacks any creature. For purposes of this spell, an attack includes any spell targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe. Exactly who is a foe depends on the invisible character's perceptions. Actions directed at unattended objects do not break the spell. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. Thus, an invisible being can open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, summon monsters and have them attack, cut the ropes holding a rope bridge while enemies are on the bridge, remotely trigger traps, open a portcullis to release attack dogs, and so forth. If the subject attacks directly, however, it immediately becomes visible along with all its gear.

You become immune to paralysis, poison, polymorph effects, sleep effects, and stunning.<br/><br/><b> Protection</b>: An aura of protective energy surrounds you.

Each creature you bite must succeed at a Fortitude save or become sickened for 1d4 rounds (or if already sickened, staggered for 1 round); this is a poison effect.<br/><br/><b> Strength</b>: Your body visibly ripples with muscle. You gain a +6 enhancement bonus to Strength.<br/><br/><b> Sun</b>: Your form blazes with solar light. You are immune to blindness, the dazzled condition, and all effects generated by powerful light (such as <i>searing light</i>, <i>sunray</i>, or the blinding light of a shining child), and you radiate light as the <i>daylight</i> spell.

You gain a +6 enhancement bonus to Constitution.<br/><br/><b> Trickery</b>: Your appearance changes as you desire (as <i>veil</i>, except affecting only yourself).

You are immune to cold damage and no longer need to breathe. You can exist comfortably in the depths of outer space.<br/><br/><b> War</b>: You are surrounded by the sounds of battle. You gain a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls with your deity\u2019s favored weapon and deal an additional 1d6 points of damage with your deity\u2019s favored weapon each time you hit a foe. You can use your deity\u2019s favored weapon as a divine focus or holy symbol.<br/><br/><b> Water</b>: You gain gills, webbed fingers, and other ichthyic features. You gain a swim speed of 40 feet, can breathe water, and ignore the usual penalties on weapon attack and damage rolls from fighting underwater.<br/><br/><b> Weather</b>: Your hair and clothing are constantly wind-tossed, and you crackle with electricity. You do not take penalties or damage or suffer from reduced visibility or other effects due to natural weather. You are immune to electricity damage, and your <i>call lightning</i> and <i>call lightning storm</i> spells and effects always function as though called outdoors in stormy weather. ",

    "des": "This powerful, elaborate, and risky spell undoes Pharasma\u2019s judgment, returning a willing petitioner to its mortal life. This spell must be cast on the plane to which the petitioner was sent, and the petitioner must be present for the entire casting. In addition, the caster must provide a specific object that the petitioner valued deeply in its mortal life as a focus for the spell. This is different for every petitioner and usually requires research to discover, although those who knew the petitioner well in life can often identify the item easily. At the completion of the spell\u2019s casting, the petitioner returns to the mortal form it had as a young adult, with all of its memories and class levels (or equivalent statistics) intact.<br/><br/> The casting of <i>judgment undone</i> is not without risk. The servants of Pharasma vigilantly watch for perversions of the order of fate and death, though it can take time for them to pinpoint disruptions when they occur. After 1d6+5 minutes from the beginning of this spell\u2019s 10-minute casting time, an olethros appears within 50 feet of the caster; this psychopomp demands the caster cease casting the spell immediately and attacks if its request is ignored. The psychopomp never attempts to harm the petitioner unless <i>judgment undone</i> has already been successfully cast by the time the psychopomp arrives, in which case it attempts to eliminate the returned mortal as well. If the caster and returned mortal are no longer present, the olethros does what she can to track both down and exact judgment\u2014how successful she may be depends on the GM\u2019s discretion.<br/><br/> The caster of <i>judgment undone</i> can pause the spell\u2019s casting for up to 1 minute without causing the spell to fail. During this time, the caster does not need to concentrate on <i>judgment undone</i> and can act normally and cast other spells without disrupting the spell, but if she does not begin casting again before this 1-minute window elapses, the spell fails.<br/><br/> It is possible to cast <i>judgment undone</i> without incurring the wrath of a psychopomp, but doing so requires the caster to first visit the Boneyard and seek out a powerful agent of Pharasma to gain permission to restore the petitioner to its mortal life. The details and difficulty of this task are subject to the GM\u2019s discretion, but at the very least should involve a significant expenditure of time and resources. The granting of permission to cast <i>judgment undone</i> is an excellent reward for a quest given to a party of adventurers from a powerful psychopomp. If the PCs exceed expectations in fulfilling this quest, it\u2019s not unheard of for the psychopomp to not only grant permission for the spell\u2019s casting, but to also provide the diamonds needed for the spell\u2019s material component, information about the required focus, or even both. Worshipers of Pharasma who cast this spell without securing permission in this manner are considered to have grossly violated Pharasma\u2019s code of conduct.",

Any excess damage affects you as normally. The energy remains stored until it is expended or the spell expires.<br/><br/> If you have at least 6 points of damage stored, you can expend all the energy stored in you as a swift action, charging your hand or a metal weapon in your hand. As a standard action while your hand is charged, you can make a melee touch attack that doesn\u2019t provoke attacks of opportunity, or you can shoot the energy as a ray with a range of 30 feet. If the attack hits, you deal 1d6 points of electricity damage for every 6 points stored and the energy is expended (any remaining points are wasted). A weapon charged with this energy deals the damage as extra damage the first time you score a hit with the weapon. If your hand or weapon is still charged at the end of your turn, or if the charged weapon leaves your hand before the end of the turn, the energy dissipates harmlessly.<br/><br/> Once you have spent the absorbed energy, or if the absorbed energy dissipates, you can absorb more electricity damage. The maximum amount of damage you can store in your body at a time increases by 6 points for every 2 levels beyond 5th (to a maximum of 60 points of damage at 19th level).<br/><br/> If you are immune to electricity or have any amount of electricity resistance, you cannot absorb or expend energy with this spell.",

If the circle of powdered silver laid down in the process of spellcasting is broken, the effect immediately ends. The trapped creature can do nothing that disturbs the circle, directly or indirectly, but other creatures can. If the called creature has spell resistance, it can test the trap once a day. If you fail to overcome its spell resistance, the creature breaks free, destroying the circle. A creature capable of any form of dimensional travel (<i>astral projection</i>, <i>blink</i>, <i>dimension door</i>, <i>etherealness</i>, <i>gate</i>, <i>plane shift</i>, <i>shadow walk</i>, <i>teleport</i>, and similar abilities) can simply leave the circle through such means. You can prevent the creature's extradimensional escape by casting a <i>dimensional anchor</i> spell on it, but you must cast the spell before the creature acts. If you are successful, the <i>anchor</i> effect lasts as long as the <i>magic circle</i> does. The creature cannot reach across the <i>magic circle</i>, but its ranged attacks (ranged weapons, spells, magical abilities, and the like) can. The creature can attack any target it can reach with its ranged attacks except for the circle itself.<br/><br/>You can add a special diagram (a two-dimensional bounded figure with no gaps along its circumference, augmented with various magical sigils) to make the <i>magic circle</i> more secure. Drawing the diagram by hand takes 10 minutes and requires a DC 20 Spellcraft check. You do not know the result of this check. If the check fails, the diagram is ineffective. You can take 10 when drawing the diagram if you are under no particular time pressure to complete the task. This task also takes 10 full minutes. If time is no factor at all, and you devote 3 hours and 20 minutes to the task, you can take 20.<br/><br/>A successful diagram allows you to cast a <i>dimensional anchor</i> spell on the <i>magic circle</i> during the round before casting any summoning spell. The <i>anchor</i> holds any called creatures in the <i>magic circle</i> for 24 hours per caster level. A creature cannot use its spell resistance against a <i>magic circle</i> prepared with a diagram, and none of its abilities or attacks can cross the diagram. If the creature tries a Charisma check to break free of the trap (see the <i>lesser planar binding</i> spell), the DC increases by 5. The creature is immediately released if anything disturbs the diagram\u2014even a straw laid across it. The creature itself cannot disturb the diagram either directly or indirectly, as noted above.<br/><br/>This spell is not cumulative with <i>protection from evil</i> and vice versa.",

Then you can attempt to take control of a nearby body, forcing its soul into the <i>magic jar</i>. You may move back to the jar (thereby returning the trapped soul to its body) and attempt to possess another body. The spell ends when you send your soul back to your own body, leaving the receptacle empty. To cast the spell, the <i>magic jar</i> must be within spell range and you must know where it is, though you do not need line of sight or line of effect to it. When you transfer your soul upon casting, your body is, as near as anyone can tell, dead.<br/><br/>While in the <i>magic jar</i>, you can sense and attack any life force within 10 feet per caster level (and on the same plane of existence). You do need line of effect from the jar to the creatures. You cannot determine the exact creature types or positions of these creatures. In a group of life forces, you can sense a difference of 4 or more HD between one creature and another and can determine whether a life force is powered by positive or negative energy. (Undead creatures are powered by negative energy. Only sentient undead creatures have, or are, souls.)<br/><br/>You could choose to take over either a stronger or a weaker creature, but which particular stronger or weaker creature you attempt to possess is determined randomly.<br/><br/>Attempting to possess a body is a full-round action. It is blocked by <i>protection from evil</i> or a similar ward. You possess the body and force the creature's soul into the <i>magic jar</i> unless the subject succeeds on a Will save. Failure to take over the host leaves your life force in the <i>magic jar</i>, and the target automatically succeeds on further saving throws if you attempt to possess its body again.<br/><br/>If you are successful, your life force occupies the host body, and the host's life force is imprisoned in the <i>magic jar</i>. You keep your Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, level, class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, alignment, and mental abilities. The body retains its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, hit points, natural abilities, and automatic abilities. A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal. You can't choose to activate the body's extraordinary or supernatural abilities. The creature's spells and spell-like abilities do not stay with the body.<br/><br/>As a standard action, you can shift freely from a host to the <i>magic jar</i> if within range, sending the trapped soul back to its body. The spell ends when you shift from the jar to your own body.<br/><br/>If the host body is slain, you return to the <i>magic jar</i>, if within range, and the life force of the host departs (it is dead). If the host body is slain beyond the range of the spell, both you and the host die. Any life force with nowhere to go is treated as slain.<br/><br/>If the spell ends while you are in the <i>magic jar</i>, you return to your body (or die if your body is out of range or destroyed). If the spell ends while you are in a host, you return to your body (or die, if it is out of range of your current position), and the soul in the <i>magic jar</i> returns to its body (or dies if it is out of range).

The mouth cannot utter verbal components, use command words, or activate magical effects.

Commands can be as general or as detailed as desired, although only visual and audible triggers can be used. Triggers react to what appears to be the case. Disguises and illusions can fool them. Normal darkness does not defeat a visual trigger, but magical <i>darkness</i> or <i>invisibility</i> does. Silent movement or magical <i>silence</i> defeats audible triggers. Audible triggers can be keyed to general types of noises or to a specific noise or spoken word. Actions can serve as triggers if they are visible or audible. A <i>magic mouth</i> cannot distinguish alignment, level, Hit Dice, or class except by external garb.<br/><br/>The range limit of a trigger is 15 feet per caster level, so a 6th-level caster can command a <i>magic mouth</i> to respond to triggers as far as 90 feet away.

This doorway takes on any form of your choosing, but can be no larger than a 5-foot cube. This spell has different effects depending on whether you are inside a mindscape when you cast it.<br/><br/>When you cast this spell outside a mindscape, the doorway connects to one mindscape inhabited by a creature of your choice within close range (25 feet + 5 feet per 2 levels) of the door. That creature becomes the door\u2019s conduit, but can attempt a Will save to deny access to the mindscape. You must be aware of the mindscape to connect a <i>mindscape door</i> to it. If you connect to the mindscape, you designate any number of creatures to be able to see and pass through the door as though it were a normal doorway. You can name specific creatures or categories of creatures, or allow all creatures access. Creatures other than those you designate can\u2019t perceive or use the door, nor can mindless creatures or those immune to mind-affecting effects. Once anyone enters the mindscape through the door, a duplicate of the door appears inside the mindscape next to the creature you used as a conduit. Anyone inside a mindscape is able to perceive and use a <i>mindscape door</i> within that mindscape. Anyone who enters is subject to all rules of the mindscape, but is aware she is in a mindscape if you informed her where the portal leads.<br/><br/>When you cast this spell inside a mindscape, a duplicate of the door appears next to your body in the real world. The creator of the mindscape can attempt a Will saving throw to prevent you from creating the door if she is within the mindscape. The two doors operate as if you\u2019d cast the spell outside a mindscape. You still designate who can use the door from the real world to get into the mindscape, but you can\u2019t prevent creatures within the mindscape from exiting to the real world.<br/><br/>Typically, a <i>mindscape door</i> operates in both directions, but you can create it as a one-way door if you so choose. Unlike with other spells, you can cast this spell as a full-round action while engaged in a psychic duel. This spell can be used to exit a binary mindscape, but not to enter one. If you successfully cast <i>mindscape door</i> within a veiled mindscape, you learn that you are in a mindscape, but other creatures observing the door don\u2019t automatically realize they are.",

You must specify a location known to you or one of your travelers as your destination when casting this spell.<br/><br/> When traveling the otherworldly paths of the Dead Roads, you move at a speed of 50 miles per hour regardless of the terrain on the Material Plane. Your own movement speed does not change; you simply arrive at distant destinations more quickly because the Dead Roads offer a shorter route. You can exit the Dead Roads at any point before reaching your destination by wandering off the path, in which case you are usually returned to your starting place. If this would place you within a solid object, you (and any creatures with you) are shunted to the nearest empty space available.<br/><br/> Because the Dead Roads occupy another plane, it is impossible to spy on the Material Plane while using this spell without additional spells or supernatural abilities.<br/><br/> <i>Open the Dead Roads</i> can be used to travel to or from the Shadow Plane, the Ethereal Plane, the Astral Plane, or the Boneyard; any of these destinations requires 10 hours of travel. Thanks to their unique nature, the Dead Roads can be used to travel from any plane to the Material Plane\u2014a trip likewise requiring 10 hours\u2014unless that plane normally bars all extraplanar travel.<br/><br/> Creatures you bring with you to the Dead Roads are not obligated to follow you. If they wander off, there is an 80% chance they arrive at a random point on the Material Plane within 2d6\u00d710 miles of your starting point, otherwise they arrive in the Boneyard.",

Tasks might range from the simple to the complex. You must be able to communicate with the creature called in order to bargain for its services.<br/><br/> The creature called requires a payment for its services. This payment can take a variety of forms, from donating gold or magic items to an allied temple, to a gift given directly to the creature, to some other action on your part that matches the creature's alignment and goals. Regardless, this payment must be made before the creature agrees to perform any services. The bargaining takes at least 1 round, so any actions by the creature begin in the round after it arrives.<br/><br/> A task taking up to 1 minute per caster level requires a payment of 100 gp per HD of the creature called. For a task taking up to 1 hour per caster level, the creature requires a payment of 500 gp per HD. A long-term task, one requiring up to 1 day per caster level, requires a payment of 1,000 gp per HD.<br/><br/> A nonhazardous task requires only half the indicated payment, while an especially hazardous task might require a greater gift. Few if any creatures will accept a task that seems suicidal (remember, a called creature actually dies when it is killed, unlike a summoned creature). However, if the task is strongly aligned with the creature's ethos, it may halve or even waive the payment.<br/><br/> At the end of its task, or when the duration bargained for expires, the creature returns to its home plane (after reporting back to you, if appropriate and possible).<br/><br/> Note: When you use a calling spell that calls an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it is a spell of that type.</span></td></tr><tr><td><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl03_LabelName\">",

    "des": "Casting this spell attempts a dangerous act: to lure a creature from another plane to a specifically prepared trap, which must lie within the spell's range. The called creature is held in the trap until it agrees to perform one service in return for its freedom.<br/><br/>To create the trap, you must use a <i>magic circle</i> spell, focused inward. The kind of creature to be bound must be known and stated. If you wish to call a specific individual, you must use that individual's proper name in casting the spell.<br/><br/>The target creature is allowed a Will saving throw. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature resists the spell. If the saving throw fails, the creature is immediately drawn to the trap (spell resistance does not keep it from being called). The creature can escape from the trap by successfully pitting its spell resistance against your caster level check, by dimensional travel, or with a successful Charisma check (DC 15 + 1/2 your caster level + your Charisma modifier). It can try each method once per day. If it breaks loose, it can flee or attack you. A <i>dimensional anchor</i> cast on the creature prevents its escape via dimensional travel. You can also employ a calling diagram (see <i>magic circle against evil</i>) to make the trap more secure.<br/><br/>If the creature does not break free of the trap, you can keep it bound for as long as you dare. You can attempt to compel the creature to perform a service by describing the service and perhaps offering some sort of reward. You make a Charisma check opposed by the creature's Charisma check. The check is assigned a bonus of +0 to +6 based on the nature of the service and the reward. If the creature wins the opposed check, it refuses service. New offers, bribes, and the like can be made or the old ones reoffered every 24 hours. This process can be repeated until the creature promises to serve, until it breaks free, or until you decide to get rid of it by means of some other spell. Impossible demands or unreasonable commands are never agreed to. If you ever roll a natural 1 on the Charisma check, the creature breaks free of the spell's effect and can escape or attack you.<br/><br/>Once the requested service is completed, the creature need only to inform you to be instantly sent back whence it came. The creature might later seek revenge. If you assign some open-ended task that the creature cannot complete through its own actions, the spell remains in effect for a maximum of 1 day per caster level, and the creature gains an immediate chance to break free (with the same chance to resist as when it was trapped). Note that a clever recipient can subvert some instructions.<br/><br/>When you use a calling spell to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it is a spell of that type.",

The bloodstone can only store racial spell-like abilities that emulate a spell, including altered spells, like  <i>invisibility</i> (self only), but not unique spell-like abilities possessed by the creature. Abilities with altered effects are still altered, so a creature activating the bloodstone for <i>greater teleport</i> (self only) would affect only itself and a bloodstone storing <i>summon monster II</i> (Small fire elemental only) would still only be able to summon a Small fire elemental. Additionally, the bloodstone can\u2019t store spell-like abilities that duplicate spells with expensive components costing more than 250 gp.<br/><br/> The save DC, caster level, and other attributes of this ability remain the same as when the creature was still alive, though the creature who activates the bloodstone can choose the targets, area, or shape of the spell, and make other decisions, such as controlling the target of <i>dominate person</i>. The bloodstone can take any actions necessary to manipulate aspects of the spell, concentrating on the spell, redirecting the spell, and so on, up to a full normal round\u2019s worth of actions.<br/><br/> If the sacrificed creature doesn\u2019t die during the casting of the spell (for instance if it was merely a summoned creature) or is brought back to life before the spell\u2019s duration expires, the bloodstone loses its magical power.

The body retains its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, hit points, natural abilities, and automatic abilities. A body with extra limbs doesn\u2019t allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal.

    "des": "This spell wards a creature from attacks by evil creatures, from mental control, and from summoned creatures. It creates a magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 1 foot. The barrier moves with the subject and has three major effects.<br/><br/>First, the subject gains a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance bonus on saves. Both these bonuses apply against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures.<br/><br/>Second, the subject immediately receives another saving throw (if one was allowed to begin with) against any spells or effects that possess or exercise mental control over the creature (including enchantment [charm] effects and enchantment [compulsion] effects, such as <i>charm person</i>, <i>command</i>, and <i>dominate person</i>. This saving throw is made with a +2 morale bonus, using the same DC as the original effect. If successful, such effects are suppressed for the duration of this spell. The effects resume when the duration of this spell expires. While under the effects of this spell, the target is immune to any new attempts to possess or exercise mental control over the target. This spell does not expel a controlling life force (such as a ghost or spellcaster using <i>magic jar</i>), but it does prevent them from controlling the target. This second effect only functions against spells and effects created by evil creatures or objects, subject to GM discretion.<br/><br/>Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by evil summoned creatures. This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature. Summoned creatures that are not evil are immune to this effect. The protection against contact by summoned creatures ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature. Spell resistance can allow a creature to overcome this protection and touch the warded creature.<h2 class=\"title\">Mythic Protection from Evil</h2><b>Source</b> <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Mythic Adventures pg. 105</i></a><br/>The bonuses to AC and on saves increase to +4. Any evil creature attempting to possess or exercise mental control over the target must attempt a Will save against this spell. If it fails, the creature takes 1d6 points of damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 5d6) from mental feedback.

Outsiders without an outsider racial subtype (like genies, night hags, yeth hounds, or xills) are not affected by this spell.<br/><br/>This spell creates a magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 1 foot. The barrier moves with the subject and has three major effects.<br/><br/>First, the subject gains a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saves when targeted by creatures of the chosen subtype.<br/><br/>Second, the subject immediately receives another saving throw (if one was allowed to begin with) against any spells or effects that possess or exercise mental control over the target creature. This functions in the same fashion as <i>protection from evil</i>, but only when the effect stems from outsiders of the chosen subtype, and the target\u2019s saving throw is made with a +4 morale bonus (using the same DC as the original effect).<br/><br/>Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by summoned creatures of the chosen subtype in the same manner as detailed in <i>protection from evil</i>.<br/><br/>This spell\u2019s descriptor varies depending on the outsider race selected, gaining the alignment descriptors opposite to the alignment of the outsider race\u2014for example, lawful and good if the race is chaotic and evil, chaotic if the selected race is lawful, or none if the selected race is neutral.",

It creates a magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 1 foot. The barrier moves with the subject and has two major effects.<br/><br/> First, the target gains a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws. Both of these bonuses apply against attacks made or effects caused by technological objects and creatures with the robot subtype.<br/><br/> Second, the target immediately receives another saving throw (if one was allowed to begin with) against any technological effects that exercise mental control over the creature, including the effects of pharmaceuticals such as torpinal. The target gains a +2 morale bonus on this saving throw, using the same DC as the original effect. If the target succeeds at this save, such effects are suppressed for the duration of this spell. The effects resume when the duration of this spell expires. While under the effects of this spell, the target is immune to any new attempts to exercise mental control over her using technological means.",

You must have seen or heard the material within a time frame of 1 week per level. For example, you might wish to reexamine a passage of text from an ancient manuscript you rapidly scanned in a library 2 weeks prior. While in the <i>psychic asylum</i>, you can perfectly recall the precise layout of the text within the ancient manuscript and read it word for word. Once you emerge from the <i>psychic asylum</i>, you can recall the details of what you had just studied as clearly as if you had just looked at it, but you no longer have total recall of the material.<br/><br/>If you\u2019re able to prepare spells, you can use the time to prepare a single spell. For example, if you were poisoned, you could use your swift action to cast <i>psychic asylum</i>, pray and meditate for the full 15 minutes to gain <i>neutralize poison</i>, then emerge from the mindscape and immediately cast the spell upon yourself as your standard action.<br/><br/>Any mind-affecting spell that was affecting you before you cast the spell continues to expend its duration on you while you are within the <i>psychic asylum</i>, so you can use this spell to wait out the effects of such a condition.

The target corpse must be fresh\u2014either dead for no more than 24 hours or appropriately preserved by an effect such as <i>gentle repose</i>. While casting the spell, you must remain in contact with the corpse while touching the living target with the focus item. As the spell is cast, the dead body\u2019s flesh unravels like ribbons to sheathe the living target, who must be within one size category of the corpse. While the spell is in effect, the focus item must remain within 30 feet of the target living creature.<br/><br/> The living target gains the physical appearance and size of the corpse, and gains its abilities as defined in <i>alter self</i> as well as any immunities, weapon proficiencies, weaknesses, and spell resistance the dead target had while living. The living target gains a +20 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks to impersonate the individual whose corpse is targeted by this spell. The disguise created by <i>recorporeal incarnation</i> lasts for a number of weeks equal to your caster level, or until the focus item is moved more than 30 feet away from the living target. When the effect ends, the living target returns to its normal form, sloughing off the corpse\u2019s flesh.<br/><br/> The greatest strength of <i>recorporeal incarnation</i> is the difficulty of detecting it as a disguise. If subjected to <i>detect magic</i>, the living target sheds no magical aura, though the focus item gives off an aura of strong necromantic magic. <i>True seeing</i> does not reveal the living target\u2019s true form, since the corpse\u2019s flesh magically obscures it. The spell <i>detect undead</i> and similar effects indicate the living target is an undead creature, but the target is not truly undead, and is not affected by any other effects that target undead creatures. <i>Recorporeal incarnation</i> does not disguise the target\u2019s alignment.<br/><br/> If the living target of <i>recorporeal incarnation</i> dies while the spell is in effect, the spell continues.

If the subject\u2019s soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work; therefore, a subject that wants to return receives no saving throw.<br/><br/> Since the dead creature is returning in a new body, all physical ills and afflictions are repaired.

So long as some small portion of the creature\u2019s body still exists, it can be reincarnated, but the portion receiving the spell must have been part of the creature\u2019s body at the time of death. The magic of the spell creates an entirely new young adult body for the soul to inhabit from the natural elements at hand. This process takes 1 hour to complete. When the body is ready, the subject is reincarnated.<br/><br/> A reincarnated creature recalls the majority of its former life and form. It retains any class abilities, feats, or skill ranks it formerly possessed. Its class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, and hit points are unchanged.

First eliminate the subject\u2019s racial adjustments (since it is no longer necessarily of his previous race) and then apply the adjustments found below to its remaining ability scores. The subject of the spell gains two permanent negative levels when it is reincarnated.

While reincarnation is a significant part of the culture of certain races\u2014particularly the <a href=\"RacesDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Samsaran\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\">samsarans</a>, who reincarnate countless times over the centuries on their slow paths toward perfection and enlightenment\u2014the use of the spell <i>reincarnate</i> allows any character to experience this mystical and fundamentally life-changing event. The table of random races presented here expands on the one presented with the reincarnate spell in the <i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i>. At the GM\u2019s discretion, you may use the following optional table when rolling to determine what new body is generated when a <i>reincarnate</i> spell is cast. This Golarion-specific table excludes all races that possess racial Hit Dice, but also adds in new races that are relatively widespread and common in the region. Not all of the races presented in this book appear on the following table\u2014<a href=\"RacesDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Android\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\">androids</a>, for example, are beyond the scope of a <i>reincarnate</i> spell to create (although dead androids and <a href=\"RacesDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Wyrwood\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\">wyrwoods</a> can themselves be reincarnated, they have no chance of coming back in the same type of body). Others, such as <a href=\"RacesDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Kasatha\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\">kasathas</a> and other alien races, are not true natives of Golarion and thus lack the \u201cspiritual weight\u201d needed to be included in a table of reincarnation possibilities. Of course, a result of \u201cGM\u2019s choice\u201d gives each GM the opportunity to break these assumptions about allowed incarnations as she sees fit.<br/><br/> When using these expanded tables, roll first on the Core Incarnations table. This table presents an array of familiar races. Move on to the Other Incarnations table only if directed to do so. This larger list presents a selection of less-common races from across Golarion, some of which might be familiar to the people of the Inner Sea, while others might be almost entirely alien. If the incarnation rolled has multiple ethnicities or heritages\u2014as is the case with <a href=\"RacesDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Aasimar\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\">aasimar</a>, <a href=\"RacesDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Dhampir\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\">dhampir</a>, and several similar races\u2014 randomly determine which ethnicity or heritage applies to the new incarnation.

before the casting of the spell to return to life in a body that closely resembles its original body; it functions as <i>reincarnate</i> except as noted. <i>Cyclic reincarnation</i> returns the dead creature to life in a new body of the same race that the target belonged to in life, and the new body appears physically similar to the creature\u2019s previous one, to the extent that the creature could be easily mistaken for its own offspring or kin. If the affected creature isn\u2019t a humanoid, there is a 75% chance that the creature returns to life as a youth of its race, gaining the young creature simple template instead (or becomes a juvenile, in the case of dragons and other creatures whose power is determined by their age category).<br/><br/> You can use <i>cyclic reincarnation</i> on someone who was killed by a death effect or turned into an undead creature and then destroyed, but nonhumanoids so restored always return to life with the young creature simple template (or as a juvenile, in the case of creatures whose power is determined by their age category).<h1 class=\"title\">Reincarnate Spy</h1><b>Source</b> <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9j6p?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Ultimate-Intrigue\r\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Ultimate Intrigue pg. 223</i></a><br/><b>School</b> <u><a href=\"SpellDefinitions.aspx?ID=2\">conjuration</a></u> (<u><a href=\"SpellDefinitions.aspx?ID=17\">healing</a></u>); <b>Level</b> druid 6, hunter 6, shaman 6, witch 7<h3 class=\"framing\">Casting</h3><b>Casting Time</b> 10 minutes<br/><b>Components</b> V, S, DF, M (oils worth 2,500 gp and a possession or piece of the body of the creature to resemble)<h3 class=\"framing\">Effect</h3><b>Range</b> touch<br/><b>Target</b> dead creature touched<br/><b>Duration</b> instantaneous<br/><b>Saving Throw</b> none (see text); <b>Spell Resistance</b> yes<h3 class=\"framing\">Description</h3>This spell functions as <i>reincarnate </i>except that you can cause the new body to resemble a particular creature, matching its age category and sex and rerolling any race result that would be the wrong size category.

    "des": "You cast the target out of your religion as a curse and punishment for acts or misdeeds against the tenets of your faith. This has three effects.<br/><br/>First, the target is marked with a magical symbol visible only to members of your faith. This symbol indicates that the target has transgressed and that the faithful should not help it. Likewise, the target is not to be persecuted because of the mark (though this would not keep members of a lawful faith from imprisoning a known criminal if these crimes were known to have taken place after he gained the mark).<br/><br/>Second, the target is no longer affected by helpful spells cast by the faithful and is always treated as an enemy for the purpose of other spells cast by those of your faith. For example, <i>cure light wounds </i>cast by a member of your faith has no effect on the target. If the target were traveling with a cleric of your faith who cast <i>prayer</i>, that spell would penalize rather than aid the target, despite the target\u2019s friendship with the cleric.<br/><br/>Third, if the target is a divine spellcaster, a member of a prestige class of your faith, or otherwise has some ability because the target belongs to your faith, it cannot use those abilities while the mark remains in place. For example, a paladin of your faith would be unable to cast paladin spells or use lay on hands or other class abilities. The target can join another faith to regain the use of these abilities, but the mark remains visible to those of your faith, even if those of the new faith accept the target.<br/><br/>This powerful spell with no saving throw is used to punish severe transgressions that do not deserve death or when you prefer to be merciful rather than meting out a more severe punishment. However, the spell has one drawback that prevents it from being overused. If the target did not commit any acts or misdeeds against your faith, the spell does not affect it but affects you instead, even if you are innocent of the charges. This potential backlash prevents inquisitions run by corrupt members of the faith, and it means that most accusations of misconduct are carefully investigated (and usually verified with magic) before this sentence is handed down.<br/><br/>This mark can be removed like any other curse effect. In addition, a member of your faith can use <i>atonement </i>to break the curse if he makes a caster level check against your caster level; <i>remove curse </i>also requires a caster of your faith and a caster level check to end the <i>reprobation</i>.",

You can choose to summon one of the following: one bebilith, one vrock, 1d3 shadow demons, 1d3 succubi, 1d4+1 babaus, or 1d4+1 brimoraks.",

As a move action, the caster can command the rope ladder to withdraw into the hammock. When the ladder is withdrawn, the rope hammock blends in with its surroundings and muffles sounds and smells from creatures resting on it that are taking no violent actions; noticing the rope hammock requires a successful DC 20 Perception check or Survival check, even for creatures with scent.

If healed of such damage while away from other targets, a target might take damage again the day they reconvene. This disease is a curse, and can never be cured by successful saving throws. The spell can be ended on a single target only with a successful casting of <i>remove curse</i> followed by a successful casting of <i>remove disease</i> while the target is within 100 feet of at least one other target.

This spell allows you to place a rune upon another creature that can then be used to aid it at a later time. You determine the spell\u2019s effect at the time of casting by using your finger to paint a specific rune on the recipient\u2019s body with a dose of specially prepared paint worth 25 gp. The inscribed rune lasts for 24 hours or until the spell is activated.

The seven runes of rule, along with their specific effects when the user activates them, are listed below. A creature can bear only one <i>rune of rule</i> at a time.<br/><br/><b> Charity</b>: A creature bearing this mark gains a +5 insight bonus on a single attack roll or skill check attempted at the request of another creature, provided the creature bearing this mark does not gain any immediate benefit or reward for making the roll or attempting the check.<br/><br/><b> Generosity</b>: A creature bearing the rune of generosity can activate it as an immediate action, but it must do so as another creature within 30 feet activates a consumable magic item such as a potion or scroll that was given to it at some point within the last 24 hours by the creature bearing the rune. When the rune is activated, the effects of the consumable magic item resolve at a caster level that is 2 higher than the item\u2019s actual caster level.<br/><br/><b> Humility</b>: When a creature activates the rune of humility, it does not provoke attacks of opportunity for 1 round.<br/><br/><b> Kindness</b>: A creature must be using the aid another action or casting a healing spell in order to activate a rune of kindness. If the creature activates the rune while using the aid another action, the bonus imparted on a success increases to +5. If the creature instead activates the rune while casting a healing spell, the effective caster level of the spell increases by 2.<br/><br/><b> Love</b>: When a creature activates the rune of love as he casts a spell with the charm descriptor, the save DC of that spell increases by 1. Alternatively, a creature can activate the rune of love after he rolls damage for a weapon or spell attack, causing the damage dealt to become nonlethal damage.<br/><br/><b> Temperance</b>: A creature bearing the rune of temperance can activate it as an immediate action immediately upon failing a saving throw against a poison, disease, drug, or similar effect. The creature can immediately attempt a second saving throw against the effect and can use the result of that second saving throw as the actual result.<br/><br/><b> Zeal</b>: A creature that activates the rune of zeal gains a +3 bonus on Will saves, and the save DCs of all language-dependent effects created by the creature increase by 1; these effects last for 1 round.",

A sacrifice can consist of any kind of commodity the target creature favors, including living creatures, treasures, or more ephemeral offerings. While this spell is not fundamentally evil, good-aligned creatures are more selective in what offerings they accept, typically scoffing at blood sacrifices.

Several of these sacrifices involve the loss of ability scores, levels, or lives, and some can cause changes in alignment. Any change wrought by such sacrifices (loss of ability score or level, or change in alignment) cannot be recovered, cured, or undone by any spell or effect short of <i>miracle</i> or <i>wish</i>. The same is true of creatures killed as a sacrifice; such creatures cannot be resurrected by any magic less powerful than these spells.

Any alterations to a subject\u2019s memories\u2014such as by a <i> modify memory spell </i>\u2014appear in a subtly different script; a successful DC 35 Linguistics check is needed to identify this. <br/><br/> Spells that modify or remove text\u2014such as <i> erase</i> or <i>secret page </i>\u2014also affect the target\u2019s memory if they persist after its release. <i> Modify memory </i> can be used to repair any changes to its original state, or alter the accounts recorded within the book.

This spell has no effect if cast on an entirely aquatic region. If the spell is cast on an island, the effects of the spell extend to the shore but not beyond.",

Typically, the restraints appear in your hands. However, as part of the spell\u2019s casting, you can make a melee touch attack against a creature; if you succeed and the creature then fails a Reflex saving throw against the spell\u2019s DC, the locked fetters appear clasped on the creature or locked manacles clasp you and the creature together. You can instead have manacles restrain the target\u2019s limbs in front of or behind it. If you cast the spell as a full-round action, you can make melee touch attacks against two creatures you can reach. If you succeed at both attacks and both creatures fail their Reflex saving throws, you can cause the set of manacles to bind the targets together.<br/><br/> As you increase in level, the restraints become stronger and you gain more control over them. If you are 6th level or higher, you can make the restraints mithral, or you can summon Tiny or Large restraints. If you are 12th level or higher, you can summon Diminutive or Huge restraints. If you use an emerald worth at least 1,000 gp as a material component while casting this spell, as a standard action once during its duration, you can affect any creature bound by these restraints as per <i>dimensional anchor</i> with a duration of 1 minute per caster level.

Thus, you can use this spell to travel rapidly by stepping onto the Plane of Shadow, moving the desired distance, and then stepping back onto the Material Plane.<br/><br/>Because of the blurring of reality between the Plane of Shadow and the Material Plane, you can't make out details of the terrain or areas you pass over during transit, nor can you predict perfectly where your travel will end. It's impossible to judge distances accurately, making the spell virtually useless for scouting or spying. Furthermore, when the spell effect ends, you are shunted 1d10 \u00d7 100 feet in a random horizontal direction from your desired endpoint. If this would place you within a solid object, you are shunted 1d10 \u00d7 1,000 feet in the same direction.

While it\u2019s possible to make crude objects with <i>snow shape</i>, most fine details aren\u2019t possible. However, a successful Craft (weapons) check allows you to create a bladed weapon from the snow. The DC of this check is equal to the DC listed with the Craft (weapons) skill (<i>Core Rulebook</i> 93). You must be the one to make the Craft check and must do so at the time of casting this spell. A failed check means that the spell is cast normally but the weapon created is malformed and useless. This spell can only be used to craft weapons and not more precise tools or elaborate armors.<br/><br/>Once you create the item with this spell, it solidifies into super-hard ice, gaining a hardness of 5 and 10 hit points per inch of thickness. This weapon takes double damage from fire. Anyone using an ice weapon takes a \u20132 penalty on attacks due to the slippery, unwieldy nature of the weapon, but the weapon deals 1 point of cold damage in addition to its normal damage. A weapon created by this spell lasts for 24 hours before melting into uselessness.",

Loose dirt is not as troublesome as mud, but all creatures in the area can move at only half their normal speed and can't run or charge over the surface. Stone softened into clay does not hinder movement, but it does allow characters to cut, shape, or excavate areas they may not have been able to affect before.<br/><br/>While this spell does not affect dressed or worked stone, cavern ceilings or vertical surfaces such as cliff faces can be affected.

Casting this spell requires a week-long ritual involving the sacrifice of one or more sentient humanoid creatures that between them possess a total of at least 15 Hit Dice. You may not eat, sleep, or cast any other spells for the duration of this ritual. After the third day of the ritual, you must succeed at a Constitution check on each remaining day of the ritual (DC 10 + 1 for each previous check) or take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage from hunger. At the end of the ritual, you gain the exhausted condition from lack of sleep.<br/><br/> Upon completion of the ritual, the ground rumbles in a 100- foot radius centered on you. This effect lasts for 1 round. Any creature on the ground in this area that attempts to cast a spell during this round must succeed at a concentration check (DC 20 + spell level) or lose the spell. Any creature on the ground in the area that attempts to attack or move during this round must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex save at the beginning of its turn or fall prone.<br/><br/> At the beginning of your next turn, a massive fissure full of dark fire and shrieking cries appears at a point you designate within the spell\u2019s range, and a Spawn of Rovagug emerges. This creature takes the form of a thunder behemoth (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3 </i>39) with the advanced and entropic simple templates. Unlike with <i>summon monster </i>or similar spells, the caster has no control whatsoever over the called creature. The spawn immediately heads in a random direction or toward an obvious target such as a population center, destroying anything in its path, yourself and your allies included.<br/><br/> Any creature may attempt to control the called Spawn of Rovagug via spells like <i>dominate monster </i>or <i>binding</i>. However, if such an attempt fails, it draws the spawn\u2019s attention, and the monster immediately tries to destroy the creature that attempted to control it. Because the Spawn of Rovagug are all magical beasts native to the Material Plane, spells such as banishment or dismissal have no effect on the called spawn.<h2 class=\"title\">Mythic Spawn Calling</h2><b>Source</b> <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy94wj?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Inner-Sea-Gods-Hardcover\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Inner Sea Gods pg. 242</i></a><br/>When casting this spell, you can specify a particular Spawn of Rovagug\u2014 including the Tarrasque, the Armageddon Engine (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary </i>262); Chemnosit, the Monarch Worm (<i>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea Bestiary </i>47); or Volnagur, the End-Singer (<i>Inner Sea Bestiary </i>48)\u2014to call in place of the nameless behemoth spawned by the non-mythic version of this spell.

A cleric without a deity gets a weapon based on his alignment. A neutral cleric without a deity can create a <i>spiritual weapon</i> of any alignment, provided he is acting at least generally in accord with that alignment at the time.

If there is a ceiling or other barrier overhead, the maximum height of the tree cannot exceed the space available. At any point along the tree\u2019s height, you can create a sturdy wooden building that fills one 10-foot cube for every 4 caster levels you have. All portions of the structure must be adjacent to the trunk of the tree (or can have the tree trunk extend up through their spaces), but otherwise these cubes need not be contiguous. If you place the cubes so that they are contiguous, the buildings merge together, complete with ladders connecting different vertical levels. The fort is magically supported, but if the tree it is attached to is destroyed, the structure is destroyed as well (the tree has hardness 5 and 20 hp per caster level you have).<br/><br/> Each building you create has shuttered arrow slits on its walls and in the floor, granting those within the structure improved cover against attacks from outside while the arrow slits are open and total cover when they are closed. Each cube within the fort is equivalent to a <i>secure shelter</i>, other than the size and its wooded construction material (hardness 5). When you cast <i>sturdy tree fort</i>, you can designate a number of creatures equal to your caster level. Designated creatures gain a +10 bonus on Climb checks and are not denied their Dexterity bonuses while climbing on the fort\u2019s structure, as they find handholds and stable footholds easily on the tree and its buildings.<br/><br/> You cannot cast this spell in an area of worked stone, though you can cast it in natural surroundings that would not normally support the growth of a large tree, such as a cavern, desert, or glacier. If you cast this spell in a forest, jungle, or similar heavily treed terrain, the fort is camouflaged as long as its doors and windows remain closed (or even if they are open, as long as those within remain quiet and take no violent actions), requiring a successful DC 25 Perception check or Survival check to notice its presence.",

While under the effects of this spell, the ship has magical propulsion that gives it a maximum speed of 120 feet and an acceleration of 30 feet (see the <i>Skull &amp; Shackles Player\u2019s Guide </i>for details). The ship\u2019s pilot uses the normal sailing skill to control the ship while under this spell\u2019s effects, and can command it to dive and ascend as part of the vessel\u2019s normal movement. Despite the magical propulsion, the ship still requires its crew to perform its normal functions.<br/><br/> The spell protects the ship and all aboard from the dangers of drowning and pressure, but not from damage from outside obstacles or creatures. The bubble cannot be used offensively and prevents an affected ship from rising into a space that won\u2019t accommodate it (like a sea cave too small to contain it or under another vessel). Creatures can enter or leave the bubble at will, but those outside the sphere cannot be forced inside against their will, the sphere proving substantial enough that such creatures may choose whether to enter or to slip away along its sides. At the end of the spell\u2019s duration the bubble pops, causing a ship still underwater at that time to gain the sinking condition. This spell has no effect if cast upon a ship in water that cannot cover the vessel entirely.<br/><br/> Although largely beneficial, this spell can be cast on a ship whose pilot does not want to submerge her vessel.

    "des": "<i>Note:</i> Antipaladins may only summon evil creatures.<br/><br/>This spell summons an extraplanar creature (typically an outsider, elemental, or magical beast native to another plane). It appears where you designate and acts immediately, on your turn. It attacks your opponents to the best of its ability. If you can communicate with the creature, you can direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions. The spell conjures one of the creatures from the 1st Level list on Table 10\u20131. You choose which kind of creature to summon, and you can choose a different one each time you cast the spell.<br/><br/>A summoned monster cannot summon or otherwise conjure another creature, nor can it use any teleportation or planar travel abilities. Creatures cannot be summoned into an environment that cannot support them. Creatures summoned using this spell cannot use spells or spell-like abilities that duplicate spells with expensive material components (such as <i>wish</i>).<br/><br/>When you use a summoning spell to summon a creature with an alignment or elemental subtype, it is a spell of that type. Creatures on Table 10\u20131 marked with an \u201c*\u201d are summoned with the celestial template, if you are good, and the fiendish template, if you are evil. If you are neutral, you may choose which template to apply to the creature. Creatures marked with an \u201c*\u201d always have an alignment that matches yours, regardless of their usual alignment. Summoning these creatures makes the summoning spell's type match your alignment. <br/><br/><b>Nethys Note: according to the <a class=\"external-link\"

    "des": "This spell summons to your side a natural creature (typically an animal, fey, magical beast, outsider with the elemental subtype, or a giant). The summoned ally appears where you designate and acts immediately, on your turn. It attacks your opponents to the best of its ability. If you can communicate with the creature, you can direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions as you command.<br/><br/>A summoned monster cannot summon or otherwise conjure another creature, nor can it use any teleportation or planar travel abilities. Creatures cannot be summoned into an environment that cannot support them. Creatures summoned using this spell cannot use spells or spell-like abilities that duplicate spells that have expensive material components (such as <i>wish</i>).<br/><br/>The spell conjures one of the creatures from the 1st Level list on Table 10\u20132. You choose which kind of creature to summon, and you can change that choice each time you cast the spell. All the creatures on the table are neutral unless otherwise noted.<br/><br/>When you use a summoning spell to summon a creature with an alignment or elemental subtype, it is a spell of that type. All creatures summoned with this spell without alignment subtypes have an alignment that matches yours, regardless of their usual alignment. Summoning these creatures makes the summoning spell's type match your alignment.<table class=\"inner\"><tr><td><b>1st Level</b></td><td><b>Subtype</b></td></tr><tr><td>Dire

    "url": "https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Symbol%20of%20Death",
    "des": "This spell allows you to scribe a potent rune of power upon a surface. When triggered, a <i>symbol of death</i> kills one or more creatures within 60 feet of the symbol (treat as a burst) whose combined total current hit points do not exceed 150. The <i>symbol of death</i> affects the closest creatures first, skipping creatures with too many hit points to affect. Once triggered, the <i>symbol</i> becomes active and glows, lasting for 10 minutes per caster level or until it has affected 150 hit points' worth of creatures, whichever comes first. A creature that enters the area while the <i>symbol of death</i> is active is subject to its effect, whether or not that creature was in the area when it was triggered. A creature need save against the <i>symbol</i> only once as long as it remains within the area, though if it leaves the area and returns while the <i>symbol</i> is still active, it must save again.<br/><br/>Until it is triggered, the <i>symbol of death</i> is inactive (though visible and legible at a distance of 60 feet). To be effective, a <i>symbol of death</i> must always be placed in plain sight and in a prominent location. Covering or hiding the rune renders the <i>symbol of death</i> ineffective, unless a creature removes the covering, in which case the <i>symbol of death</i> works normally.<br/><br/>As a default, a <i>symbol of death</i> is triggered whenever a creature does one or more of the following, as you select: looks at the rune; reads the rune; touches the rune; passes over the rune; or passes through a portal bearing the rune. Regardless of the trigger method or methods chosen, a creature more than 60 feet from a symbol of death can't trigger it (even if it meets one or more of the triggering conditions, such as reading the rune). Once the spell is cast, a <i>symbol of death</i>'s triggering conditions cannot be changed.<br/><br/>In this case, \u201creading\u201d the rune means any attempt to study it, identify it, or fathom its meaning. Throwing a cover over a <i>symbol of death</i> to render it inoperative triggers it if the symbol reacts to touch. You can't use a <i>symbol of death</i> offensively; for instance, a touch-triggered <i>symbol of death</i> remains untriggered if an item bearing the symbol of death is used to touch a creature. Likewise, a <i>symbol of death</i> cannot be placed on a weapon and set to activate when the weapon strikes a foe.<br/><br/>You can also set special triggering limitations of your own. These can be as simple or elaborate as you desire. Special conditions for triggering a symbol of death can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, HD, and hit points don't qualify.<br/><br/>When scribing a <i>symbol of death</i>, you can specify a password or phrase that prevents a creature using it from triggering the symbol's effect. Anyone using the password remains immune to that particular rune's effects so long as the creature remains within 60 feet of the rune. If the creature leaves the radius and returns later, it must use the password again.<br/><br/>You also can attune any number of creatures to the symbol of death, but doing this can extend the casting time. Attuning one or two creatures takes negligible time, and attuning a small group (as many as 10 creatures) extends the casting time to 1 hour. Attuning a large group (as many as 25 creatures) takes 24 hours. Attuning larger groups takes an additional 24 hours per 25 creatures. Any creature attuned to a <i>symbol of death</i> cannot trigger it and is immune to its effects, even if within its radius when it is triggered. You are automatically considered attuned to your own <i>symbols of death</i>, and thus always ignore the effects and cannot inadvertently trigger them.<br/><br/><i>Read magic</i> allows you to identify a <i>symbol</i> with a Spellcraft check (DC 10 + the symbol's spell level). Of course, if the <i>symbol</i> is set to be triggered by reading it, this will trigger the symbol.<br/><br/>A <i>symbol of death</i> can be removed by a successful <i>dispel magic</i> targeted solely on the rune. An <i>erase</i> spell has no effect on a <i>symbol of death</i>. Destruction of the surface where a <i>symbol of death</i> is inscribed destroys the <i>symbol</i> but also triggers it.<br/><br/><i>Symbol of death</i> can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell. A permanent <i>symbol of death</i> that is disabled or has affected its maximum number of hit points becomes inactive for 10 minutes, but then can be triggered again as normal.<br/><br/><i>Note</i>: Magic traps such as <i>symbol of death</i> are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Perception skill to find a <i>symbol of death</i> and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 33 for <i>symbol of death</i>.<h1 class=\"title\"><img src=\"images\\PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px;\" title=\"",

If you cease concentration for any reason, the object falls or stops.<br/><br/>An object can be telekinetically manipulated as if with one hand. For example, a lever or rope can be pulled, a key can be turned, an object rotated, and so on, if the force required is within the weight limitation. You might even be able to untie simple knots, though delicate activities such as these require DC 15 Intelligence checks.<br/><br/><i>Combat Maneuver</i>: Alternatively, once per round, you can use <i>telekinesis</i> to perform a bull rush, disarm, grapple (including pin), or trip. Resolve these attempts as normal, except that they don't provoke attacks of opportunity, you use your caster level in place of your Combat Maneuver Bonus, and you add your Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer) in place of your Strength or Dexterity modifier. No save is allowed against these attempts, but spell resistance applies normally. This version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentration.<br/><br/><i>Violent Thrust</i>: Alternatively, the spell energy can be spent in a single round. You can hurl one object or creature per caster level (maximum 15) that are within range and all within 10 feet of each other toward any target within 10 feet per level of all the objects. You can hurl up to a total weight of 25 pounds per caster level (maximum 375 pounds at 15th level).<br/><br/>You must succeed on attack rolls (one per creature or object thrown) to hit the target with the items, using your base attack bonus + your Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer). Weapons cause standard damage (with no Strength bonus; note that arrows or bolts deal damage as daggers of their size when used in this manner). Other objects cause damage ranging from 1 point per 25 pounds (for less dangerous objects) to 1d6 points of damage per 25 pounds (for hard, dense objects). Objects and creatures that miss their target land in a square adjacent to the target.<br/><br/>Creatures who fall within the weight capacity of the spell can be hurled, but they are allowed Will saves (and spell resistance) to negate the effect, as are those whose held possessions are targeted by the spell.<br/><br/>If a telekinesed creature is hurled against a solid surface, it takes damage as if it had fallen 10 feet (1d6 points).<h2 class=\"title\">Mythic Telekinesis</h2><b>Source</b> <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Mythic Adventures pg. 110</i></a><br/>The duration of this spell changes to 1 round per level. You may spend a move action to use the sustained force or combat maneuver effects of the spell.<br/><br/> When using sustained force, you can move a number of objects up to your tier. These must be in the same square and together must weigh no more than the weight limit of the spell.<br/><br/> Using the violent thrust effect ends the spell, but the weight restriction increases to 50 pounds per caster level (maximum 750 pounds).

If you intend to keep creatures from activating it accidentally, you need to mark the circle in some way.<br/><br/><i>Teleportation circle</i> can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell. A permanent <i>teleportation circle</i> that is disabled becomes inactive for 10 minutes, then can be triggered again as normal.<br/><br/>Magic traps such as <i>teleportation circle</i> are hard to detect and disable. A character with the trapfinding class feature can use the Disable Device to disarm magic traps. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 34 in the case of <i>teleportation circle</i>.",

    "des": "This spell allows you to witness two divergent decisions and choose which to pursue. Upon completing this spell, you must immediately choose two other different spells that you could cast at that moment and that each have a casting time of 1 standard action; these spells take effect simultaneously, and you must track all resulting effects, areas of effect, saving throws, and other outcomes separately as if each had been cast normally and the other spell had never happened. Once you\u2019ve seen how each spell resolves, you must choose which version of reality occurred, expending the standard action, prepared spell, and material components as necessary. The other spell\u2019s results are ignored and do not require an action or expend the prepared spell, spell slot, or material components. If the targets of the spell you did not choose expended any resources or effects to resist your spell, those resources or effects are also not expended. If you cast this spell and do not or cannot immediately follow the instructions described above, this spell has no effect.<br/><br/> For example, after casting this spell, a wizard could cast <i>temporal stasis</i> on a demon and <i>fireball</i> on a group of orcs. Seeing that the demon succeeds at its saving throw against <i>temporal stasis</i> and that the <i>fireball</i> kills many orcs, the wizard chooses the <i>fireball</i> to take effect. The <i>temporal stasis</i> is treated as if it had not been cast, and its spell slot and costly material component are not expended.<br/><br/> Casting this spell more than once in a single day is risky. On the second and subsequent casting in a 24-hour period, you must succeed at a DC 25 Will saving throw or be exposed to a crippling array of possibilities and paradoxes that leave you confused for 24 hours. Whenever this confusion would cause you to attack the nearest creature, you instead expend your highest-level remaining prepared spell or spell slot, if any, with no effect.",

    "des": "You alter the area\u2019s terrain and climate to a new terrain and climate type appropriate to the planet or plane. For example, you might transform a desert to plains. To cast this spell, you must expend 10 uses of mythic power along with the material cost. This magically alters the area\u2019s climate and normal plants to those appropriate to the new terrain, but doesn\u2019t affect creatures or the configuration of the earth. Transforming rocky hills into forested areas converts grasses into shrubs and small trees, but doesn\u2019t flatten the hills or change the animals to suit the new environment.<br/><br/> You can alter the climate by one step (warm, temperate, or cold). The maximum extent of the terrain change is up to the GM, but in general is to a similar terrain type or one step within that terrain type (such as from a typical forest to a forest with massive trees or light undergrowth, from a shallow bog to a deep bog, and so on). You might be able to shift the land to a similar terrain type, such as turning a sparse forest into a relatively dry swamp. Local creatures adversely affected by these alterations either flee the area or quickly die, depending on their mobility and awareness of the change.<br/><br/> Multiple castings of the spell in the same area can create an area with radically different terrain and climate than the surrounding land. The GM can decide that certain terrain shifts are unsustainable and shorten the duration, or that some are suitable for the area and extend the duration.<br/><br/> This spell could have many secondary effects based on the nature of the change, the type of bordering terrain, and so on; these should be determined by the GM on a case-by-case basis. For example, transforming a desert requires drawing water up from underground to sustain the plants, which could deplete the water table in nearby areas. Creating a warm desert in the middle of a snowy tundra will create a bordering area of mud and frequent storms from the clash of hot and cold air fronts.<br/><br/> If you\u2019re at least 8th tier, you can expend 20 uses of mythic power instead of 10 to increase the range to 1 mile, the area to a 1-mile-radius emanation centered on you, and the duration to 1 month per caster level.",

The gem holds the trapped entity indefinitely or until the gem is broken and the life force is released, which allows the material body to reform. If the trapped creature is a powerful creature from another plane, it can be required to perform a service immediately upon being freed. Otherwise, the creature can go free once the gem imprisoning it is broken.<br/><br/>Depending on the version selected, the spell can be triggered in one of two ways.<br/><br/><i>Spell Completion</i>: First, the spell can be completed by speaking its final word as a standard action as if you were casting a regular spell at the subject. This allows spell resistance (if any) and a Will save to avoid the effect. If the creature's name is spoken as well, any spell resistance is ignored and the save DC increases by 2. If the save or spell resistance is successful, the gem shatters.<br/><br/><i>Trigger Object</i>: The second method is far more insidious, for it tricks the subject into accepting a trigger object inscribed with the final spell word, automatically placing the creature's soul in the trap. To use this method, both the creature's name and the trigger word must be inscribed on the trigger object when the gem is enspelled. A <i>sympathy</i> spell can also be placed on the trigger object. As soon as the subject picks up or accepts the trigger object, its life force is automatically transferred to the gem without the benefit of spell resistance or a save.<h1 class=\"title\"><img src=\"images\\PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px;\" title=\"",

The knife deals 1d4 points of force damage on a successful hit and has the same threat range and critical multipliers as a normal dagger.

A spell or effect with a duration greater than that of the suppression effect resumes functioning normally when the suppression ends.

The wall does not suppress a creature\u2019s ability to cast spells, use spell-like abilities, or any other sort of limited-use abilities even if the wall suppresses a particular application of those abilities. However, if a creature with magical abilities that are constant or otherwise always active passes through the wall, those abilities are suppressed for the normal duration.<br/><br/>The wall blocks line of effect, so no spell or effect can pass through the wall, but it does not block line of sight.

    "des": "A <i>wall of thorns</i> spell creates a barrier of very tough, pliable, tangled brush bearing needle-sharp thorns as long as a human's finger. Any creature forced into or attempting to move through a <i>wall of thorns</i> takes piercing damage per round of movement equal to 25 minus the creature's AC. Dexterity and dodge bonuses to AC do not count for this calculation. (Creatures with an AC of 25 or higher, without considering Dexterity and dodge bonuses, take no damage from contact with the wall.)<br/><br/>You can make the wall as thin as 5 feet thick, which allows you to shape the wall as a number of 10-by-10-by-5-foot blocks equal to twice your caster level. This has no effect on the damage dealt by the thorns, but any creature attempting to break through takes that much less time to force its way through the barrier.<br/><br/>Creatures can force their way slowly through the wall by making a Strength check as a full-round action. For every 5 points by which the check exceeds 20, a creature moves 5 feet (up to a maximum distance equal to its normal land speed). Of course, moving or attempting to move through the thorns incurs damage as described above. A creature trapped in the thorns can choose to remain motionless in order to avoid taking any more damage.<br/><br/>Any creature within the area of the spell when it is cast takes damage as if it had moved into the wall and is caught inside. In order to escape, it must attempt to push its way free, or it can wait until the spell ends. Creatures with the ability to pass through overgrown areas unhindered can pass through a wall of thorns at normal speed without taking damage.<br/><br/>A <i>wall of thorns</i> can be breached by slow work with edged weapons. Chopping away at the wall creates a safe passage 1 foot deep for every 10 minutes of work. Normal fire cannot harm the barrier, but magical fire burns it away in 10 minutes.<h2 class=\"title\">Mythic Wall of Thorns</h2><b>Source</b> <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Mythic Adventures pg. 112</i></a><br/>The damage dealt increases to 30 minus the creature\u2019s AC.

Two to five <i>wish</i> spells cast in immediate succession can grant a creature a +2 to +5 inherent bonus to an ability score (two <i>wishes</i> for a +2 inherent bonus, three <i>wishes</i> for a +3 inherent bonus, and so on). Inherent bonuses are instantaneous, so they cannot be dispelled. <i>Note</i>: An inherent bonus may not exceed +5 for a single ability score, and inherent bonuses to a particular ability score do not stack, so only the best one applies.</li><li>Remove injuries and afflictions.

For example, you could heal all the damage you and your companions have taken, or remove all poison effects from everyone in the party, but not do both with the same <i>wish</i>.</li><li>Revive the dead. A <i>wish</i> can bring a dead creature back to life by duplicating a <i>resurrection</i> spell.

The <i>wish</i> forces a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a <i>wish</i> could undo an opponent's successful save, a foe's successful critical hit (either the attack roll or the critical roll), a friend's failed save, and so on. The reroll, however, may be as bad as or worse than the original roll.

This wave of terrain undulates as it passes over the world, harmlessly lifting or stretching objects, creatures, and phenomena with a connection to nature but tearing through and damaging anything else it encounters. When you cast the spell you must choose the wave\u2019s type, either a tsunami or a swell. If you choose a tsunami, you create a 30-foot-high tidal wave of earth or water hurtling across the landscape that lasts for 1 round per level. If you choose a swell, you create a more controlled and gentle 5-foot-high wave that lasts for 1 hour per level. Regardless of its form or composition, the crest of the wave extends 10 feet in front of and behind you, and 5 feet per level to both your left and right. You can stand or sit on the crest of this wave without any fear of falling off it and can even lie down and sleep (or take any other actions you could take if standing on solid ground) as it travels. You can grant up to one additional creature per level the ability to safely accompany you on this wave. <br/><br/>When you first create the wave, you must choose its path by facing the direction you wish it to travel. Once you make this decision, you cannot change it. The wave, in either version, moves at eight times your base land speed. Any object, creature, or phenomena strongly connected to, or a part of, the natural world simply rises up and down with the wave as it passes, taking no damage or injury. However, anything else coming into contact with the wave takes either 6d6 points of bludgeoning damage (if the tsunami) or 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage (if the swell). The wave damages any manufactured object or structure. On the Material Plane, it also damages any creature of the aberration, construct, outsider, or undead type, or with the extraplanar subtype. Creatures with the construct or undead type take double damage from the wave. Other creatures, or creatures with even one druid class level (regardless of their type), are considered a part of the natural world and are unaffected by the wave. Note that on other planes of existence, what is considered to be a part of the natural world may vary at the GM\u2019s discretion.<br/><br/>The wave can travel up or down the sides of natural features so long as it does not exceed a 45-degree angle. You cannot alter the dimensions of the wave as it travels. If the wave encounters terrain that it cannot incorporate into itself, the wave simply flows over or around the obstacle (creatures riding the wave are harmlessly displaced to the side to avoid the obstacle) unless the terrain occupies one-half or more of the area of the wave\u2019s crest. In such cases the spell ends in 1d6 rounds as the wave falters and collapses, unless its duration would normally cause it to expire prior to that. The momentum of the wave carries you forward through this new terrain without any injury until it collapses, at which point you suffer the normal effects of the terrain in which you are deposited. Terrain the wave cannot incorporate includes anything primarily made from fire (such as lava), air (such as an open cliff face), or something man-made (such as a city). <br/><br/>You can only create the wave if standing on the ground. You cannot create it when underground or on terrain that it cannot incorporate.",

Any creature that starts its turn within the area of the spinning blades takes 1d4 points of damage for every two caster levels (maximum 10d4 at 20th level) and the damage bypasses DR/silver. <br/><br/>Furthermore, the daggers ward off some attacks, in a way similar to the <i>warding weapon </i>spell. While subject to this spell, you do not provoke attacks of opportunity for casting spells, even from creatures with the Disruptive feat.
